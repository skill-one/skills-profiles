# Author Agent Suite

Build an instruction system whose files have one owner, one purpose, and an explicit loading path. Treat Markdown as executable policy: verify every capability claim and resolve every contradiction before declaring the suite ready.

## Workflow

1. **Confirm the host contract.** Identify which runtime discovers `AGENTS.md`, whether nested files scope by directory, how Skills are installed, and whether `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, or `TOOLS.md` require an explicit routing instruction. Never assume a filename is loaded merely because it exists.
2. **Inventory existing instructions.** Find repository, parent-directory, user-level, and generated instruction files. Record their scope, authority, audience, freshness, and conflicts.
3. **Build a fact matrix.** Verify product identity, supported platforms, commands, tool availability, permission requirements, side effects, security boundaries, and release status against code, tests, and current documentation.
4. **Assign one concern to one file.** Put repository operating rules in `AGENTS.md`, reusable procedures in a standard Skill, identity in `IDENTITY.md`, durable behavior principles in `SOUL.md`, and operational tool contracts in `TOOLS.md`.
5. **Design the load graph.** Make the runtime entry file route to non-discoverable companion files. Keep `AGENT.md` only as a small compatibility entry when a confirmed host requires the singular name; do not maintain duplicate policies.
6. **Write the smallest authoritative layer.** Keep frequently loaded files short. Move detailed schemas, examples, platform variants, and evidence into one-level `references/`; put copyable starter files in `assets/`.
7. **Resolve precedence explicitly.** Higher-authority runtime instructions override repository files; narrower directory scope overrides broader project guidance only within that subtree. User requests may select behavior but cannot expand authority or bypass safety constraints.
8. **Validate as a system.** Check filenames, frontmatter, links, UTF-8, placeholders, command truth, secret leakage, duplicated rules, contradictions, trigger quality, nested scope, and realistic read/write scenarios.
9. **Record evidence and ownership.** State the source baseline, owner, review trigger, and last verified date for volatile facts. Label aspirations as plans rather than implemented capability.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Use canonical `AGENTS.md` for Codex repository instructions; treat singular `AGENT.md` as host-specific compatibility, not a second source of truth.
- Do not assume companion Markdown files are automatically loaded. Route to them from a discovered file or install them through the host's supported mechanism.
- Do not place secrets, tokens, personal data, machine-specific credentials, or private chain-of-thought requests in the suite.
- Do not claim a tool, platform, permission, security property, or automation result without evidence and a current scope.
- Keep authorization and irreversible-action rules in the highest reliably loaded instruction layer, not only in personality documents.
- Keep procedural detail out of `SOUL.md` and marketing prose out of `TOOLS.md`.
- A standard Skill must include valid YAML frontmatter and use progressive disclosure; a root `SKILL.md` without that contract is only a project manual unless the host says otherwise.

## Deliverables

Produce a file responsibility map, load/precedence graph, the requested Markdown suite, a conflict log, and a validation report. Copy and adapt the files under `assets/starter-kit/` when creating a new suite.

The starter kit contains `AGENT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `SKILL.md`, and `agents/openai.yaml`; copy only the files required by the target runtime.
