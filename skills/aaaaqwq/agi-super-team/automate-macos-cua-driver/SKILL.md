# Automate macOS with cua-driver

Treat cua-driver as a versioned transport with explicit capabilities. Keep AX perception, page-level evidence, foreground input, and business-state verification separate.

## Workflow

1. **Pin the runtime contract.** Record macOS, Chrome, cua-driver, packaged app, and target-site versions. Run driver health and tool-description checks; do not assume a capability from an older version.
2. **Establish permissions.** Verify Accessibility and Screen Recording for the actual executable or signed app identity. Verify Chrome automation/page-bridge prerequisites only when the workflow needs them.
3. **Start one daemon.** Prefer the packaged driver app when required for TCC identity. Pass only documented or deliberately version-pinned environment flags. Wait for readiness with a bounded probe.
4. **Own one session.** Use a unique session name, close stale same-name sessions before starting, and register idempotent cleanup for normal exit, signals, exceptions, and timeouts.
5. **Find and activate the target window.** Match application and window identity, reject hidden or invalid geometry, and foreground only immediately before actions that require it.
6. **Read fresh AX state.** Locate elements by role, label, ancestry, and current frame. Treat element indexes as snapshot-local and reacquire after scrolling or navigation.
7. **Choose the correct action path.** Use the page bridge for DOM-only identity or authenticated in-page fetches when supported. Use foreground driver mouse/keyboard delivery for visible business actions that must behave like user input.
8. **Verify the business result.** Poll a new AX/page snapshot for the intended state transition. Driver success, `verified`, or an accepted event is not enough.
9. **Protect identity and files.** Bind selected object, visible panel, action source, preview, downloaded file, hash, and persisted owner. Fail closed on disagreement.
10. **Recover cleanly.** Close previews, clear draft input when appropriate, end the session, and confirm the driver did not hide or strand the browser window.

## Capability policy

- Feature-detect `page`, JavaScript mutation, background/foreground delivery, screenshot, and AX-tree behavior per driver version.
- Keep version-specific escape hatches near daemon startup and cover them with tests. Do not scatter environment assumptions through business scripts.
- Prefer a page bridge for DOM identifiers and same-session authenticated fetches; prefer visible foreground input for user-facing business actions.
- Represent unknown state separately from false. A bridge error is not evidence that a preview, dialog, or element is absent.

## Failure policy

- Reacquire stale elements; never retry an old index blindly.
- Stop sensitive processing when the active candidate/object identity changes.
- Do not consume content behind a preview whose presence cannot be determined.
- Distinguish permission denial, daemon unavailable, tool unsupported, bridge refusal, target not found, input delivery failure, and no post-state change.
- Capture redacted AX state, window metadata, driver response path, before/after identity, and screenshot for bounded failures.
