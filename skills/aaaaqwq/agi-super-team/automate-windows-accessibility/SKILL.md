# Automate Windows Accessibility

Separate perception, identity, action, and proof. A successful API return is never proof that the target application changed state.

## Architecture

Use this default split:

```text
Element semantics and geometry  -> native UI Automation
Stable web identity and DOM evidence -> read-only CDP
Mouse, keyboard, wheel, drag -> Win32 SendInput
Post-action truth -> fresh UIA/CDP/application state
Window, process, DPI, screenshot -> Win32 APIs
```

Keep business code behind a platform-neutral adapter. Do not leak HWNDs, screen coordinates, UIA runtime IDs, or CDP session objects into domain models.

## Workflow

1. **Establish the window.** Resolve the owning process and top-level HWND. Reject minimized, hidden, zero-sized, or sentinel off-screen windows. Restore and foreground only when an action needs it.
2. **Take a bounded snapshot.** Read UIA through a worker or supervisor with a hard timeout. Include control type, accessible name, automation ID, class, rectangle, enabled/off-screen state, parent relation, and supported patterns.
3. **Bind by semantics and context.** Match exact role/type plus normalized label, then bind through parent/child context to the intended card, row, panel, or dialog. Treat indexes and runtime tokens as snapshot-local.
4. **Make the target visible.** If virtualized or off-screen, scroll the correct container, wait, and take a new snapshot. Never click coordinates from the pre-scroll snapshot.
5. **Compute screen coordinates once.** Use Per-Monitor DPI awareness and virtual-desktop coordinates. Do not rescale an already physical screen origin. Support negative monitor coordinates.
6. **Deliver the action.** Prefer `SendInput` for Chromium/web content. Use UIA patterns for native controls when their semantics are reliable, but still verify the result.
7. **Verify with fresh evidence.** Poll for a target-specific state transition: selected identity, dialog appearance/disappearance, field value, button state, URL, attachment, or content signature.
8. **Retry safely.** Reacquire the element before each retry. Bound attempts, capture diagnostics, and fail closed when identity or state is ambiguous.
9. **Clean up.** Ensure UIA workers, process job objects, input state, previews, and foreground changes are recovered on normal exit, exception, timeout, or interruption.

## Safety rules

- Use CDP as evidence by default; do not mix a DOM click with a path intended to behave like OS input.
- Bind downloads and persisted records to a stable identity, operation source, preview evidence, and file hash.
- Stop on login, challenge, verification, or unexpected navigation pages. Never automate challenge completion.
- Do not claim `SendInput` is indistinguishable from physical hardware. Windows can mark injected input.
- Do not continue reading the previous panel after a click that produced no confirmed state change.
- Do not treat an empty UIA tree as proof that the page contains no target.
- Use pacing to absorb rendering races, not to promise evasion of platform detection.

## Diagnostics

Capture the fresh UIA snapshot, matched element metadata, window state, DPI/monitor map, intended and delivered coordinates, before/after identity, URL, retry reason, and screenshot. Redact personal or secret data before sharing diagnostics.
