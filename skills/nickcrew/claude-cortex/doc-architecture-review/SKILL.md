# Documentation Architecture Review

Evaluate whether documentation is organized so that readers can find what they need,
understand where they are, and navigate efficiently. The output is an architecture
assessment with specific restructuring recommendations — not new content.

## When to Use

- When restructuring or reorganizing documentation
- When adding a new section or doc type to an existing set
- When users report "I know it's documented somewhere but can't find it"
- When the doc set has grown organically and needs rationalization
- After `doc-completeness-audit` identifies gaps — before filling them, ensure the structure
  can accommodate new content
- Periodic review of navigation and discoverability

## Quick Reference

| Resource | Purpose | Load when |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `references/personas.md` | Six concrete reader personas with eval signals | Always (Phase 0) |
| `scripts/link_graph.py` | Mechanical link-graph analyzer (orphans, reciprocity, broken links, hubs) | Always (Phase 1) |
| `references/ia-heuristics.md` | Doc-type-aware IA evaluation heuristics | Always (Phase 2) |

---

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 0: Personas    → Establish the doc set's primary 1-3 personas
Phase 1: Map         → Build the current doc structure map (incl. link graph)
Phase 2: Evaluate    → Score against IA heuristics, parameterized by personas + doc type
Phase 3: Model       → Compare structure to user mental models per persona
Phase 4: Report      → Produce the architecture review with per-persona findings
```

---

## Phase 0: Establish Personas

A "good" architecture is good *for someone specific*. Without personas,
the heuristics apply a default standard that systematically misjudges
docs serving non-default audiences (a flat reference doc scored as
"poorly hierarchical" because it doesn't follow Quick Start → advanced).

### Step 0a — Identify the doc set's audiences

Read the doc set's entry pages (README, `index.md`, landing pages) and
the highest-traffic top-level docs. Identify which 1–3 personas from
`references/personas.md` are the primary readers. Common patterns:

| Doc set shape | Likely personas |
|---|---|
| Library / SDK with public API | API Looker-Up + Onboarding User |
| End-user product | Onboarding User + Operator |
| Internal infrastructure | Operator + Incident Responder + Architect Debugger |
| OSS project | Onboarding User + Contributor |
| Operations-heavy system | Operator + Incident Responder |

### Step 0b — Draft persona profiles

For each identified persona, copy the profile from
`references/personas.md` verbatim. Don't paraphrase — the explicit
profile is what calibrates downstream sub-agents. If a persona almost
fits but a dimension differs, define a custom persona using the same
five-field structure.

### Step 0c — Note conflicts

If the doc set serves more than one persona with conflicting needs
(e.g., Onboarding User wants narrative, API Looker-Up wants terseness),
note this explicitly. The synthesis report will surface where current
structure favors one persona at the cost of another.

**Output:** A persona block (1–3 personas + any conflict notes) that
feeds every downstream sub-agent prompt.

---

## Phase 1: Map the Current Structure

Build a complete picture of the documentation architecture.

### Step 1a: Physical Structure

Generate the file tree of all documentation:

```bash
find docs/ site/ -name '*.md' -o -name '*.html' | sort
```

Record:
- Directory hierarchy and nesting depth
- File count per directory
- Naming conventions (kebab-case, snake_case, mixed)

### Step 1b: Navigation Structure

Identify every way a reader can navigate:

| Navigation type | Where to find it |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Sidebar / table of contents | `_config.yml` nav, front matter `nav_order`/`parent`, `SUMMARY.md` |
| Landing pages | `index.md` files — read each one for link lists |
| In-page cross-references | `[text](link)` and `{% link %}` references between pages |
| Breadcrumbs | Theme configuration or layout templates |
| Search | Search configuration, indexed content |
| Previous/Next links | Auto-generated or manual `nav_order` sequencing |

### Step 1c: Entry Points

Identify how readers arrive:

- **Direct** — typing a URL or bookmarking
- **Search** — site search or external search engine
- **Navigation** — sidebar, breadcrumb, landing page links
- **Cross-reference** — link from another doc page
- **External** — README, GitHub, blog post, error message linking to docs

Map which pages are reachable from each entry point. Pages unreachable from common
entry points are effectively invisible.

### Step 1d: Link Graph (mechanical)

Run the bundled link graph analyzer to extract deterministic facts about
inter-doc linking:

```bash
python3 skills/doc-architecture-review/scripts/link_graph.py --scope all --json > graph.json

# Or human-readable:
python3 skills/doc-architecture-review/scripts/link_graph.py --scope all
```

The script produces:

- **Orphans** — pages with no inbound links (excluding entry points like
  `index.md` and `README.md`). Direct input to Heuristic 1 (Findability).
- **Dead-ends** — pages with no outbound links. Content silos.
- **Reciprocity ratio** — fraction of edges that have a back-link. Direct
  input to Heuristic 4 (Cross-Linking Quality).
- **Hubs** — pages with high in-degree. Natural reference targets.
- **Broken links** — internal links that don't resolve. Direct input to
  Heuristic 4.

These are *mechanical facts*, not judgments. The judgment-heavy parts of
Heuristics 1 and 4 (are links contextual? do navigation labels use user
language?) are evaluated by sonnet sub-agents in Phase 2.

**Output:** A structure map with physical hierarchy, navigation paths, entry points,
and the link graph JSON.

---

## Phase 2: Evaluate Against IA Heuristics

Assess the structure against seven heuristics. Load `references/ia-heuristics.md`
for detailed scoring criteria.

### Mechanical vs judgment split

For a doc set of any meaningful size, the orchestrator can't read every page
to score every heuristic — that strains the context window and produces
patchy evaluation. Phase 2 splits work:

- **Mechanical part** — driven by the Phase 1d link graph JSON. Orphan
  counts, reciprocity ratio, broken-link counts, hub identification: these
  are facts, not judgments. The orchestrator reads the JSON and assigns
  scores deterministically.
- **Judgment part** — dispatched to `general-purpose` + `sonnet` sub-agents
  organized by heuristic. Each agent receives a focused slice of the doc set
  and returns specific findings with citations.

### Sonnet sub-agent dispatch

Three judgment-heavy heuristics warrant dedicated agents. Each agent's
prompt **inlines the persona block from Phase 0** and the relevant
doc-type criteria from `references/ia-heuristics.md`. The agent scores
*per-persona*, not against a generic default.

**Agent 1 — Findability narrative review** (Heuristic 1):

```
subagent_type: "general-purpose"
model: "sonnet"
description: "Findability narrative review"
```

Prompt template:
```
Read landing pages, navigation configs (_config.yml, front-matter
nav_order/parent), and the orphans list from the link graph JSON.

Personas (from Phase 0):
<INLINE PERSONA BLOCK — full profile per persona, not summary>

Doc-type criteria for Heuristic 1:
<INLINE Heuristic 1 section from references/ia-heuristics.md>

For each persona, score Findability 1-5 and identify specific failures:
- Are navigation labels in this persona's language?
- Are entry points appropriate for how this persona arrives?
- Are orphans concentrated in a doc type that fails this persona's task?

Output per-persona scores plus findings. When personas conflict (e.g.,
nav labels in one's language fail another), surface the conflict
explicitly rather than averaging.
```

**Agent 2 — Cross-linking quality review** (Heuristic 4):

```
subagent_type: "general-purpose"
model: "sonnet"
description: "Cross-link quality review"
```

Prompt template:
```
Read 5-10 representative pages across doc types. Read the link graph
JSON's reciprocity statistics.

Personas (from Phase 0):
<INLINE PERSONA BLOCK>

Doc-type criteria for Heuristic 4:
<INLINE Heuristic 4 section from references/ia-heuristics.md — note
the per-doc-type linking patterns table>

For each persona, score Cross-Linking 1-5. Distinguish:
- Are links contextual (explain why to follow)? Low priority for
  Looker-Up reference scanning, high priority for Onboarding User
  exploration.
- Does linking density match the doc type's pattern?
- Are there mutual links between related concepts (high reciprocity)
  where appropriate?
```

**Agent 3 — Pattern consistency review** (Heuristic 5, **per-doc-type
dispatch**):

For each doc type present (reference, tutorial, guide, explanation,
ADR, runbook, README), dispatch one sonnet agent with all docs of that
type:

```
subagent_type: "general-purpose"
model: "sonnet"
description: "Consistency review for <doc-type>"
```

Prompt template:
```
Examine all <DOC_TYPE> docs in the set: <LIST_OF_PATHS>.

Persona affected (from Phase 0):
<INLINE PERSONA BLOCK for this doc type's primary persona>

Expected template for <DOC_TYPE> per references/ia-heuristics.md
Heuristic 5:
<INLINE template signals row>

Identify the implicit template — common section headings, structural
conventions — and flag pages that deviate. For each deviation:
- Is it intentional (handles a special case the template doesn't
  cover)? Note the reason.
- Is it accidental (older page; different author; conventions hadn't
  settled)? Flag for harmonization.

Score 1-5 for within-type consistency.
```

### Heuristic scoring

### Heuristic 1: Findability

Can readers locate information without knowing where it lives?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Multiple discovery paths to every page. Search works. Navigation reflects user goals |
| 3 | Most content findable via navigation or search. Some pages only reachable by direct link |
| 1 | Content buried. No search. Navigation reflects implementation, not user needs |

**Check:**
- Orphaned pages (no inbound links, not in navigation)
- Dead ends (pages with no outbound links to related content)
- Search coverage (are all pages indexed? do headings use searchable terms?)
- Navigation labels (do they use user language or developer jargon?)

### Heuristic 2: Hierarchy Coherence

Does the nesting make sense? Can a reader predict where to find something?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Clean, predictable hierarchy. Each level represents a meaningful grouping. Max 3 levels deep |
| 3 | Generally logical but some surprises. Occasional misplaced content. 4 levels in places |
| 1 | Arbitrary nesting. Related content scattered. Deep hierarchies (5+). Categories overlap |

**Check:**
- Depth — flag anything nested >3 levels
- Breadth — flag directories with >10 immediate children (consider subcategories)
- Sibling coherence — are items at the same level truly peers?
- Naming — do directory names describe contents from the reader's perspective?

### Heuristic 3: Progressive Disclosure

Does the doc set layer information from simple to complex?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Clear learning path. Quick start → guides → reference → advanced. Each layer self-sufficient |
| 3 | Some layering exists but not explicit. Reader may hit advanced content before basics |
| 1 | All content at same depth. No distinction between introductory and advanced material |

**Check:**
- Quick start exists and is prominently linked
- Getting started path is linear and completable in <15 minutes
- Advanced topics are separated from basics, not interleaved
- Each doc states its prerequisites
- Cross-references point readers to deeper material, not shallower

### Heuristic 4: Cross-Linking Quality

Do links between pages create useful connections or noise?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Links are contextual, bidirectional where appropriate, and create meaningful paths |
| 3 | Links exist but some are one-directional, orphaned, or link to the wrong section |
| 1 | Few cross-links. Pages are isolated. No "See also" or "Related" patterns |

**Check:**
- Link density — pages with zero outbound links, pages with >20
- Reciprocity — if A links to B, does B link back (where appropriate)?
- Context — links explain *why* the reader would follow them, not just "click here"
- Anchor precision — links go to the right section, not just the right page
- Broken links — links that resolve to 404 or wrong content

### Heuristic 5: Consistency of Patterns

Do similar pages follow similar structures?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Clear templates per doc type. All reference pages look alike. All tutorials follow the same flow |
| 3 | Some patterns visible but not universal. Newer docs follow conventions, older ones don't |
| 1 | Every page is a snowflake. No discernible pattern across similar content types |

**Check:**
- Do all reference pages have the same sections?
- Do all tutorials follow the same progression?
- Do all guides have prerequisites and next steps?
- Are metadata conventions (front matter, titles, descriptions) consistent?

### Heuristic 6: Separation of Concerns

Are different doc types (reference, tutorial, guide, explanation) kept distinct?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Clear separation. Reference is reference. Tutorials are tutorials. No hybrid pages |
| 3 | Mostly separated but some pages mix types (reference data inside a tutorial) |
| 1 | No separation. Single pages try to be reference, tutorial, and explanation simultaneously |

**Check:**
- Pages that mix "how to" with "what it is" with "API details"
- Tutorials that double as reference (readers can't scan for a specific flag)
- Reference pages that include narrative explanations better suited to guides
- Use the Diataxis framework as a lens: tutorials, how-to guides, reference, explanation

### Heuristic 7: Maintenance Burden

Is the structure sustainable as docs grow?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Adding a new doc page requires no restructuring. Clear home for every doc type |
| 3 | Most new content has a natural home. Occasional need to reorganize |
| 1 | Every new page requires debate about where it goes. Structure is at capacity |

**Check:**
- Is there a clear directory/category for new feature docs?
- Are naming conventions documented and followed?
- Would doubling the doc set break the navigation?
- Are there catch-all directories growing without bounds?

---

## Phase 3: Mental Model Comparison

Compare the documentation structure to how users actually think about the product.

### User Mental Models

Identify the primary mental models users bring:

| Model type | Structure | Example |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| **Task-based** | "I want to do X" | Organized by workflow: install → configure → deploy |
| **Feature-based** | "I want to learn about X" | Organized by component: agents, skills, rules, hooks |
| **Role-based** | "I'm a [role]" | Organized by audience: user guide, admin guide, developer guide |
| **Chronological** | "What do I do first?" | Organized by sequence: getting started → daily use → advanced |

Most doc sets serve multiple models. The question is: **which model does the navigation
reflect, and does it match the primary user need?**

### Mismatch Indicators

- Users search for task-based terms but docs are organized by feature
- Getting started guide assumes feature knowledge the reader doesn't have yet
- Navigation uses internal terminology that users don't recognize
- Users land on the right page but can't find the right section

## Phase 4: Produce the Architecture Review

### Report Format

```markdown
# Documentation Architecture Review

**Review date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Scope:** [doc set reviewed]
**Total pages:** N
**Max depth:** N levels
**Orphaned pages:** N
**Personas evaluated:** [comma-separated list from Phase 0]

---

## Personas

[Inline the Phase 0 persona block — full profile per persona, plus any conflict notes]

---

## Summary

[2-3 sentences: overall architecture assessment, per-persona where relevant]

Heuristic scores per persona:

| Heuristic | Persona A | Persona B | Persona C | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Findability | N/5 | N/5 | N/5 | [one line, surface persona conflicts] |
| Hierarchy Coherence | N/5 | N/5 | N/5 | [one line] |
| Progressive Disclosure | N/5 or N/A | N/5 or N/A | N/5 or N/A | [N/A is valid for reference/ADR — see rubric] |
| Cross-Linking Quality | N/5 | N/5 | N/5 | [one line] |
| Consistency of Patterns | N/5 | N/5 | N/5 | [one line] |
| Separation of Concerns | N/5 | N/5 | N/5 | [one line] |
| Maintenance Burden | N/5 | N/5 | N/5 | [one line] |
| **Per-persona total** | **N/35** | **N/35** | **N/35** | |

Architecture grade per persona: [A / B / C / D / F]

When grades differ across personas, that's a finding, not a defect to
average away. Flag the structural bias toward whichever persona scores
highest.

```

---

## Integration with Other Doc Skills

```
doc-maintenance         →  Structural health (links, orphans, folders)
doc-claim-validator     →  Semantic accuracy (do claims match code?)
doc-completeness-audit  →  Topic coverage (is everything documented?)
doc-quality-review      →  Prose quality (is it well-written?)
doc-architecture-review →  Information architecture (is it findable?)
```

Run this skill *after* `doc-completeness-audit` — you need to know what's missing before
evaluating whether the structure can accommodate it. Run *before* filling gaps, so new
content lands in the right place.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not reorganize during the review — produce findings, not a new file tree
- Do not treat your preferred structure as the "correct" one — evaluate against user needs
- Do not evaluate archived docs (`docs/archive/`) — they are historical
- Do not confuse "I know where things are" with "a new user would know" — test with fresh eyes
- Do not recommend restructuring for its own sake — the cost of moving docs (broken links,
  muscle memory, bookmarks) must be justified by the improvement
- Do not ignore the cost of change — a mediocre-but-stable structure may be better than
  a perfect structure that requires moving 50 pages
