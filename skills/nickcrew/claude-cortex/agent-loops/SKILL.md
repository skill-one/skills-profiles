# Agent Workflow Loops

This skill defines the operational loops that implementer agents follow when making
code changes and writing tests. Each loop has explicit entry criteria, exit criteria,
and escalation rules. If you are an agent, follow these loops exactly.

**You do not review your own work.** All reviews are performed by an independent
reviewer. Prefer Claude via the bundled scripts. If Claude is unavailable, use a
different model before asking your own model family to review. Same-model shell-outs
are the last resort. You never grade your own homework.

**Bundled references:**
- `references/testing-standards.md` — Test quality standards (how to write tests)
- `references/audit-workflow.md` — Test gap discovery (how to find what's missing)
- `references/perspective-catalog.md` — Review perspective selection (used by primary and fallback code review)
- `references/review-prompt.md` — Code review prompt template for fallback reviewers
- `references/audit-prompt.md` — Test audit prompt template for module-scope (full-contract) audits
- `references/diff-audit-prompt.md` — Test audit prompt template for diff-scope (per-commit) audits; used by `diff-test-audit.sh` when `--git` is active

**Bundled scripts:**
- `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh` — Provider-aware Claude/Gemini/Codex CLI path for code review
- `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh` — Provider-aware Claude/Gemini/Codex CLI path for test audit

### Locate Scripts

The bundled scripts live inside the installed skill directory, not the project tree.
Before invoking any script, resolve `SKILL_DIR` so paths work regardless of install scope:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(ls -d ~/.codex/skills/agent-loops 2>/dev/null || ls -d .codex/skills/agent-loops 2>/dev/null)"
```

All script invocations below use `"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/..."`. Run the snippet above once
at the start of your session and reuse the variable.

## Architecture: Who Does What

| Role | Agent | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Implementer** | Codex or Gemini | Writes code changes and test code |
| **Code Reviewer** | Claude preferred; non-self scripted fallback next; same-model provider last; fresh-context Codex final fallback | `specialist-review` keeps same-model shell-outs last; fallback reviewer uses bundled prompts and produces a review artifact |
| **Test Auditor** | Claude preferred; non-self scripted fallback next; same-model provider last; fresh-context Codex final fallback | `diff-test-audit` keeps same-model shell-outs last; fallback auditor uses bundled prompts and produces an audit artifact |
| **Remediator** | Codex or Gemini | Fixes findings from the independent review/audit artifact |

**Critical rule:** Codex and Gemini NEVER self-review unless every independent
provider path has already failed. Every review step must be performed by an
independent reviewer using this selection order:
1. Bundled script with automatic Claude-first, self-last provider selection
2. A fresh-context Codex reviewer that did not implement the change

If neither path is available, stop and escalate to the user.

## Why Shell-Based Review (Even for Claude)

The bundled scripts aren't a Codex/Gemini accommodation — they exist to enable
**cross-model independent review**, which every agent benefits from. The
provider rotation explicitly keeps the current agent's own model family last,
so a Claude agent invoking `specialist-review.sh` gets its review from Gemini
or Codex first, not another Claude instance.

Two kinds of reviewer independence are in play:

- **Cross-model independence** (shell scripts): reviewer is a *different model
  family* with different training data and alignment. Catches blind spots
  inherent to the current model. Requires shelling out to a different provider.
- **Fresh-context independence** (sub-agents): reviewer is the *same model
  family* but with no prior context. Catches local anchoring bias. Cheap to
  obtain via Task-tool sub-agents in Claude Code.

Agent-loops uses the first mechanism as its baseline because cross-model is a
stronger guarantee than fresh-context alone. Claude-native sub-agent flows
(like `multi-specialist-review`) add within-model multi-perspective diversity
on top of the shell-based baseline when warranted — they don't replace it.

## Reviewer Selection Order

When a review or audit is required, use this exact fallback chain:

1. **Bundled script first.** Let the bundled script try Claude, then another model
   family, and keep the current model family last. The script validates the artifact
   contract before accepting the generated artifact.
2. **Fresh-context Codex next.** Spawn a reviewer agent with fresh context. That
   agent must:
   - not have authored or edited the implementation under review
   - receive only the task spec, relevant diff/module/tests, and the bundled references
   - act only as reviewer/auditor, not as implementer
   - write its result to a markdown artifact under `.cortex/reviews/`
3. **Escalate** if no independent reviewer is available.

Treat fallback artifacts exactly like script-generated `REVIEW_FILE` or
`REPORT_FILE` outputs in the loops below. Call out fallback usage in the handoff so
humans know whether the review came from Claude, Gemini, Codex, or fresh-context Codex.

---

## Skill Invocation Reference

### Pre-Review: Impact Analysis with Codanna (Optional)

Before requesting code review, you can use codanna to understand the blast radius
of your changes. This provides grounded structural data that helps scope the review
and catch issues the diff alone won't reveal.

```bash
# What calls the functions you changed?
codanna mcp find_callers process_request --watch

# What's the full impact if this symbol changes?
codanna mcp analyze_impact DatabaseConnection --watch --json

# Feed impact data into review context
IMPACT=$(codanna mcp analyze_impact "$CHANGED_SYMBOL" --watch --json 2>/dev/null)
```

This is optional — agent-loops works without codanna. But when available, impact data
makes reviews more precise and catches downstream breakage the diff doesn't show.

### `specialist-review` — Request Code Review

**When:** After completing implementation, after each remediation cycle.
**What you get back:** Findings with severity levels (P0-P3) and a verdict (BLOCKED / PASS WITH ISSUES / CLEAN).

#### IMPORTANT: Source Files Only

Scope `specialist-review` to **source files only**. Do NOT include test files
(`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/`) in the path filter — tests are reviewed
separately in **Loop 2** via `diff-test-audit`.

#### IMPORTANT: Do Not Review the Code Yourself

Your ONLY job is to invoke an independent reviewer and read the output artifact. Do
NOT analyze the diff as the reviewer. Do NOT write review comments yourself. Do NOT
adopt perspectives yourself. Route the review to Claude first, then fallback if needed.

Claude is still the preferred reviewer because it can load domain-specific skills such as
`owasp-top-10`, `secure-coding-practices`, and `python-testing-patterns`. The bundled
script now tries Claude first, then a different model family, and keeps same-model
shell-outs for last resort. Codex and Gemini are both available as explicit providers.
If the automated providers are unavailable or fail, continue with a fresh-context Codex
reviewer instead of reviewing the code yourself.

#### Automated Path: Provider-Aware Script

> **LONG-RUNNING CALL — USE THE POLLING PATTERN BELOW.**
> This script invokes an external LLM and takes **3-5 minutes for larger diffs**.
> Do NOT start remediation, tests, or commits while the review is in progress.
> When calling from a Bash tool, set `timeout: 600000` (10 min) — the default
> 120-second timeout will kill the subprocess before the reviewer finishes.
> The review is only done when you have a `REVIEW_FILE` path in hand.

**Polling invocation (REQUIRED)** — run the review in the background and poll
so the Bash tool receives periodic output and does not time out:

```bash
# Start review in background, capture stdout (the result file path) separately
REVIEW_TMP=$(mktemp /tmp/review-out.XXXXXX)
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --git -- src/parser/ src/auth.rs \
  >"$REVIEW_TMP" &
REVIEW_PID=$!

# Poll every 15s — each echo keeps the Bash tool connection alive
while kill -0 "$REVIEW_PID" 2>/dev/null; do
  sleep 15
  echo "[poll] Review still running (pid $REVIEW_PID)..."
done

# Collect exit code and read result
wait "$REVIEW_PID"
REVIEW_EXIT=$?
if [[ $REVIEW_EXIT -eq 0 ]]; then
  REVIEW_FILE=$(cat "$REVIEW_TMP")
  echo "Review complete: $REVIEW_FILE"
  cat "$REVIEW_FILE"
else
  echo "Review failed (exit $REVIEW_EXIT):"
  cat "$REVIEW_TMP"   # contains failure summary with stderr paths and debug info
fi
rm -f "$REVIEW_TMP"
```

The script emits heartbeat lines to stderr every 15 seconds during provider
execution. Combined with the poll loop above, this ensures continuous output.

Additional invocation forms (wrap any of these in the polling pattern above):

```bash
# Review changes since a specific ref, scoped to a directory
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --git origin/main -- claude_ctx_py/

# Review all changes vs last commit (use sparingly in monorepos)
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --git

# Pipe in a pre-filtered diff
git diff HEAD~3..HEAD -- src/ | "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" -

# Review a diff file
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" /path/to/changes.diff

# Custom output directory
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --git --output ./my-reviews -- src/

# Force a specific provider
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --provider gemini --git -- src/parser/
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --provider codex --git -- src/parser/
```

**Always scope to the files you touched.** In a monorepo, an unscoped `--git` sends
the entire repo diff to the reviewer, wasting tokens and risking timeouts.

Provider selection:

- Default is `auto`, which tries Claude first, keeps the current agent's own model
  family last, and uses the remaining provider in between.
- Override per run with `--provider auto|claude|gemini|codex`.
- Override by environment with `AGENT_LOOPS_LLM_PROVIDER` or `SPECIALIST_REVIEW_PROVIDER`.
- Override provider models with `CLAUDE_MODEL`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, or `CODEX_MODEL`.
- Enable a second reviewer with `AGENT_LOOPS_SECONDARY_PROVIDER=claude|gemini|codex`
  and optionally `AGENT_LOOPS_SECONDARY_MODEL=<model>`. Use
  `SPECIALIST_REVIEW_SECONDARY_PROVIDER` / `SPECIALIST_REVIEW_SECONDARY_MODEL`
  for code-review only, or `TEST_REVIEW_SECONDARY_PROVIDER` /
  `TEST_REVIEW_SECONDARY_MODEL` for test-audit only. The script preserves both
  raw artifacts and emits one synthesized final artifact.
- To conserve Claude usage while keeping a second signal, use:
  `CLAUDE_MODEL=sonnet AGENT_LOOPS_SECONDARY_PROVIDER=codex` or
  `CLAUDE_MODEL=sonnet AGENT_LOOPS_SECONDARY_PROVIDER=gemini`.
- Set `AGENT_LOOPS_SELF_PROVIDER=claude|gemini|codex` when the current agent is not
  auto-detected. Codex, Gemini, and Claude sessions auto-detect themselves when
  their standard session markers are present.
- The script validates the review artifact shape before accepting it; invalid provider output is rejected and the next fallback is tried.
- If both CLIs are unavailable or fail, use the fresh-context Codex fallback below.

#### Manual Fallback: Fresh-Context Codex

If the bundled script cannot get a usable artifact from any scripted provider:

1. Generate the same scoped diff you would have sent to the script.
2. Provide the reviewer:
   - `references/review-prompt.md`
   - `references/perspective-catalog.md`
   - the scoped diff
   - the prior review artifact, if this is a remediation cycle
3. Require the reviewer to emit markdown that follows the `Review Output Format`
   documented later in this skill.
4. Save that output under `.cortex/reviews/review-<timestamp>-fallback.md` and treat
   the saved path as `REVIEW_FILE`.

#### Size Guards and `--jumbo`

Both `specialist-review.sh` and `diff-test-audit.sh` enforce a **soft
size guard** before sending content to the reviewer:

| Script                   | Default limit          | Env override                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `specialist-review.sh`   | 3000 diff lines        | `AGENT_LOOPS_MAX_DIFF_LINES`          |
| `diff-test-audit.sh` | 500 KB source + tests  | `AGENT_LOOPS_MAX_CONTENT_BYTES`       |

The guard behaves as a two-step decision gate, not a hard cap:

1. **First run aborts on oversize.** The abort is deliberate: it forces you
   to consider whether the change can be split before sending a large
   payload to the reviewer. The error message lists concrete split
   strategies (by path filter, by ref range, by sub-module, by logical
   scope). Try those first.

2. **If splitting doesn't make sense, rerun with `--jumbo`.** Use this flag
   when the change is genuinely cohesive and decomposing it would fragment
   a single logical unit — a refactor that only reads correctly as a whole,
   generated code, or a single-commit feature whose parts don't stand alone.
   `--jumbo` sends the full content to the reviewer (no truncation).

   ```bash
   # First run aborts with splitting guidance
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --git -- src/big-refactor/

   # After deciding the change can't be split, retry with --jumbo
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --jumbo --git -- src/big-refactor/
   ```

`--jumbo` is a considered override, not a default. Use it only after the
abort made you think about splitting. Modern provider context windows
(Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.x, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5) can absorb the full
payload, but reviewers do their best work on focused diffs — so prefer
splitting when it's natural, and reach for `--jumbo` when it isn't.

`AGENT_LOOPS_ALLOW_TRUNCATION=1` still exists for backward compatibility
but silently truncates, which produces partial reviews. Prefer `--jumbo`
over truncation in nearly every case.

#### Anti-Patterns

- **Performing the review yourself** — Use an independent reviewer, never the implementer.
- **Summarizing the diff before invoking the script** — Unnecessary. The script reads the diff directly.
- **Ignoring the output artifact** — The review is written to a file. Read it.
- **Using a same-context Codex agent as reviewer** — If Codex is the fallback reviewer, it must have fresh context and no implementation authorship.
- **Stopping at the first Claude failure** — Let the script try the non-self provider before the same-model last resort and fresh-context Codex.
- **Skipping the polling pattern** — Use the polling invocation from the section above. The review takes 3-5 minutes; without the poll loop the Bash tool will time out or the agent will lose track of the process. Set `timeout: 600000` on the Bash call.
- **Moving on before you have `REVIEW_FILE`** — The review is a gate. Do not proceed to findings triage, remediation, tests, or commit until the poll loop exits and you have a file path.
- **Reaching for `--jumbo` before considering a split** — The first-run abort is a forcing function. Use `--jumbo` only after you've decided the change is cohesive; don't paper over a legitimately splittable diff.

### `diff-test-audit` — Request Test Audit

**When:** Per-commit test coverage check — verifies the files your diff touched have adequate tests.
**What you get back:** A gap report covering both missing coverage AND test quality issues (mirror tests, flaky assertions, etc.) scoped to your changed files, with P0/P1/P2 severity.

#### Scope: Default to Diff, Not Module

This audit is a per-commit completeness check — did your change get tested — not
a module-level survey. Default to scoping by files the diff touched (`--git`
filters the audit to changed files; add `-- <paths>` to narrow further):

```bash
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" <module> --git
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" <module> --git -- <touched-files>
```

When `--git` is active, the script uses a **diff-focused prompt**
(`references/diff-audit-prompt.md`) that explicitly scopes findings to
behaviors introduced or modified by the diff. Pre-existing untested code in
touched files is **out of scope** — those gaps are not reported. This
prevents the "audit surfaces noise in neighboring code" problem a
full-contract prompt would produce even at file scope.

For full module audits (mapping a module's public contract and surveying
coverage across unmodified code), use the **`test-review` skill** instead. It
uses parallel Haiku sub-agents with synthesis — better suited to exhaustive
module work. The full-contract prompt (`audit-prompt.md`) is still used by
this script when invoked without `--git`, but that path is legacy — module
audits belong in `test-review`.

#### IMPORTANT: Do Not Audit the Tests Yourself

Your ONLY job is to invoke an independent auditor and read the output artifact. Do
NOT map behaviors yourself. Do NOT classify test coverage yourself. Do NOT produce
the gap report yourself. Route the audit to Claude first, then fallback if needed.

Claude is still the preferred auditor because it can apply the testing standards and audit
workflow with project-aware skill support. The bundled script now tries Claude first,
then a different model family, and keeps same-model shell-outs for last resort. Codex
and Gemini are both available as explicit providers. If the automated providers are
unavailable or fail, continue with a fresh-context Codex auditor instead of skipping
the audit.

#### Automated Path: Provider-Aware Script

> **LONG-RUNNING CALL — USE THE POLLING PATTERN BELOW.**
> This script invokes an external LLM and takes **3-5 minutes for larger modules**.
> Do NOT start writing tests or commits while the audit is in progress.
> When calling from a Bash tool, set `timeout: 600000` (10 min) — the default

**Polling invocation (REQUIRED)** — run the audit in the background and poll
so the Bash tool receives periodic output and does not time out:

```bash
# Start audit in background, capture stdout (the result file path) separately
# Default scope: --git filters to files the current diff touched
REPORT_TMP=$(mktemp /tmp/audit-out.XXXXXX)
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" /path/to/module --git \
  >"$REPORT_TMP" &
AUDIT_PID=$!

# Poll every 15s — each echo keeps the Bash tool connection alive
while kill -0 "$AUDIT_PID" 2>/dev/null; do
  sleep 15
  echo "[poll] Audit still running (pid $AUDIT_PID)..."
done

# Collect exit code and read result
wait "$AUDIT_PID"
AUDIT_EXIT=$?
if [[ $AUDIT_EXIT -eq 0 ]]; then
  REPORT_FILE=$(cat "$REPORT_TMP")
  echo "Audit complete: $REPORT_FILE"
  cat "$REPORT_FILE"
else
  echo "Audit failed (exit $AUDIT_EXIT):"
  cat "$REPORT_TMP"   # contains failure summary with stderr paths and debug info
fi
rm -f "$REPORT_TMP"
```

The script emits heartbeat lines to stderr every 15 seconds during provider
execution. Combined with the poll loop above, this ensures continuous output.

Additional invocation forms (wrap any of these in the polling pattern above).
All default to diff scope via `--git`; for full module audits use the
`test-review` skill, not this one.

```bash
# Default: audit changed files since main
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" /path/to/module --git

# Narrow further with explicit file filter
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" /path/to/module --git -- src/parser/ src/auth.py

# Audit changed files since a specific ref
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" /path/to/module --git origin/main

# Quick review of specific test files only
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" --quick /path/to/test_file.py

# Force a specific provider (still diff-scoped via --git)
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" --provider gemini /path/to/module --git
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" --provider codex /path/to/module --git
```

Provider selection:

- Default is `auto`, which tries Claude first, keeps the current agent's own model
  family last, and uses the remaining provider in between.
- Override per run with `--provider auto|claude|gemini|codex`.
- Override by environment with `AGENT_LOOPS_LLM_PROVIDER` or `TEST_REVIEW_PROVIDER`.
- Set `AGENT_LOOPS_SELF_PROVIDER=claude|gemini|codex` when the current agent is not
  auto-detected. Codex sessions auto-detect themselves already.
- The script validates the audit artifact shape before accepting it; invalid provider output is rejected and the next fallback is tried.
- If both CLIs are unavailable or fail, use the fresh-context Codex fallback below.

#### Manual Fallback: Fresh-Context Codex

If the bundled script cannot get a usable artifact from any scripted provider:

1. Gather the same source, tests, and bundled references the script would have used.
2. Provide the auditor:
   - `references/audit-prompt.md`
   - `references/testing-standards.md`
   - `references/audit-workflow.md`
   - the scoped module and test content
3. Require the auditor to emit markdown that follows the same gap-report contract
   used by this skill's audit loop.
4. Save that output under `.cortex/reviews/test-audit-<timestamp>-fallback.md` and
   treat the saved path as `REPORT_FILE`.

Act on findings:
- **P0 (Security/Correctness Critical)**: Fix before merge.
- **P1 (Reliability/Edge Cases)**: Fix in current sprint.
- **P2 (Completeness/Confidence)**: Backlog.

#### Size Guards and `--jumbo`

`diff-test-audit.sh` enforces the same two-step size guard as
`specialist-review.sh` (limit: 500 KB of source + tests combined). On the
first oversized run the script aborts with splitting suggestions; pass
`--jumbo` on retry if the module is cohesive and cannot be decomposed.
See the full explanation under *specialist-review → Size Guards and
`--jumbo`* above — the decision framework is identical.

```bash
# First run aborts when source+tests exceed 500 KB
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" /path/to/big/module

# After deciding the module can't be split, retry with --jumbo
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" --jumbo /path/to/big/module
```

#### Anti-Patterns

- **Performing the audit yourself** — Use an independent auditor, never the implementer.
- **Pre-reading source before invoking the script** — Unnecessary. The script passes the module path to the provider flow.
- **Ignoring the output artifact** — The gap report is written to a file. Read it.
- **Using a same-context Codex agent as auditor** — If Codex is the fallback auditor, it must have fresh context and no authorship of the tested change.
- **Proceeding without any audit artifact** — Let the script try the non-self provider before the same-model last resort and fresh-context Codex.
- **Skipping the polling pattern** — Use the polling invocation from the section above. The audit takes 3-5 minutes; without the poll loop the Bash tool will time out or the agent will lose track of the process. Set `timeout: 600000` on the Bash call.
- **Moving on before you have `REPORT_FILE`** — The audit is a gate. Do not proceed to gap analysis, test writing, or commit until the poll loop exits and you have a file path.
- **Reaching for `--jumbo` before considering a split** — The first-run abort is a forcing function. Use `--jumbo` only after you've decided the module is cohesive; don't paper over a legitimately splittable audit.

### Team Review: User-Triggered Only

Multi-specialist team review is **not an agent tool**. It is a user-triggered
operation — the cost profile (~$2-3 per review) and authority profile
(PR-level / security-sensitive changes) warrant explicit user invocation.

The orchestration lives in a dedicated skill: **`multi-specialist-review`**.
Implementers using this skill do not invoke it themselves.

#### When to flag for team review in your handoff

Recommend team review to the user when the change scope matches any of:

- PR-level changes (5+ modified files)
- Multi-commit ranges (`main..feature-branch`) rather than atomic commits
- Security-sensitive paths (auth, crypto, payments, input validation)
- Single-turn `specialist-review` flagged quality concerns you could not resolve

Your handoff should name which criterion triggered the recommendation, the
scope a team review should cover, and any findings from `specialist-review.sh`
that warrant a second look. Do not block on the user running team review —
continue with single-turn `specialist-review.sh` in the meantime.

See `skills/multi-specialist-review/SKILL.md` for the orchestration details
(Claude Code only — requires the team API).

---

## Atomic Commits: The Unit of Work

Every loop operates on **atomic commits**, not features. An atomic commit is the
smallest change that is complete, correct, and reviewable in isolation.

### What Makes a Commit Atomic

An atomic commit:
- **Does one thing.** One bug fix, one new behavior, one refactor — not all three.
- **Is self-consistent.** The codebase compiles, tests pass, and lint is clean at this commit. You could revert it without breaking other commits.
- **Is reviewable in isolation.** A reviewer can understand the intent and evaluate correctness without seeing what comes next.
- **Groups related files.** If adding a function requires updating a test and a type — that's one commit, not three.

An atomic commit is NOT:
- An entire feature with multiple independent components.
- A single file (if the logical change spans several files).
- "Everything I did today."

### How This Drives the Loops

For a multi-component feature, decompose into a sequence of atomic commits.
Each commit gets its own pass through the relevant loop:

```
Feature: "Add rate limiting to API"

  Commit 1: rate limiter data model       → Code Change Loop → commit
  Commit 2: rate limiter business logic    → Code Change Loop → commit
  Commit 3: integrate into request handler → Code Change Loop → commit
  Commit 4: tests for rate limiter         → Test Writing Loop → commit
  Commit 5: lint fixes                     → Lint Gate → commit
```

The question at every step is: **"What is my next atomic commit?"** — not
"How do I implement this feature?"

### Commit Rules

1. **Use `cortex git commit`, not `git commit`.** Unless you have explicit user
   approval to commit another way, always use `cortex git commit`. It stages files
   and commits atomically, preventing common mistakes (staging `.`, empty messages,
   committing directories). Use `cortex git patch` when you need to stage individual
   diff hunks instead of whole files.
   ```bash
   cortex git commit "fix(parser): reject CONNECT requests with missing port" src/parser.rs tests/test_parser.rs
   # For partial staging (previously: committer --patch):
   cortex git patch --diff changes.diff "fix(parser): reject CONNECT requests" src/parser.rs
   ```
2. **Dirty files are OK — use `cortex git patch`.** If a file you need to commit
   already has uncommitted changes from other work, use `cortex git patch` to commit
   only your hunks. You do **not** need to escalate unless your changes overlap with
   the already-modified lines. If they overlap, stop and coordinate with the user.
3. **Commit at the end of every loop.** Each loop exit (code change, test writing,
   lint gate) produces a commit. Do not batch multiple loop exits into one commit.
4. **Run existing tests before committing.** After implementation, after lint fixes,
   after any code change — verify the existing test suite passes. A commit that
   breaks existing tests is not atomic.
5. **Commit messages follow Conventional Commits.** `<type>(scope): <summary>`.
   The summary should describe *what changed*, not *what you were asked to do*.

### When to Split

If you find yourself in any of these situations, you need to split:
- Your diff touches more than one module for unrelated reasons.
- You're fixing a bug AND adding a feature in the same change.
- The review would need to evaluate two independent design decisions.
- You can describe your change only with "and" — "adds X **and** changes Y."

## Overview

There are three primary loops. They run sequentially — code loop, then test loop, then lint gate.

## Loop 1: Code Change Loop

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Meaning | Loop Behavior |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| P0 | Security flaw, incorrect behavior, data loss, crashes | MUST fix before exit |
| P1 | Error handling gaps, resource leaks, missing validation, concurrency issues | MUST fix before exit |
| P2 | Code quality, naming, documentation, minor edge cases | File issue, do not block |
| P3 | Style preferences, optional improvements, future optimization | File issue, do not block |

                                                 └── Loop back to findings check
```

### Deferred Findings Are Mandatory Backlog Items

No loop closes with an unfixed finding unless there is a fixing commit, a backlog
item ID, or explicit user waiver. Specifically:

- **P0 / P1**: Do not close the loop. Fix it or escalate to the user for approval.
- **P2 / P3**: Create a backlog item **before** committing and exiting the loop.
  Include in the backlog item:
  - Review/audit artifact path
  - Finding ID and title (e.g., `P2-003: Missing input validation`)
  - Affected file(s)
  - Why it was deferred
- In the final handoff message, list every deferred finding with its backlog item ID.

Do not silently carry deferred findings forward. Do not defer filing to "later" —
the backlog item must exist before the loop exit commit.

### Circuit Breaker

**Maximum iterations: 3 `specialist-review` cycles.**

If P0/P1 findings remain after 3 cycles:
1. Stop. Do not attempt a 4th remediation.
2. Produce a summary of unresolved findings with context on why they persist.
3. Escalate to human reviewer with the summary and the latest review artifact.

This prevents infinite loops when you keep introducing new issues while fixing old ones, or when a finding requires a design-level change you can't make in remediation scope.

### Code Review Checklist (Reviewer Criteria)

Any reviewer evaluates against these criteria. Use them to anticipate and prevent
issues before review, and to interpret findings during remediation.

**Correctness:**
- [ ] Does the code do what the spec says? Not more, not less.
- [ ] Are all error cases handled? No unwrap() on fallible operations in non-test code (Rust). No unhandled promise rejections (TS).
- [ ] Are numeric operations safe from overflow/underflow?
- [ ] Are string operations safe with unicode input?
- [ ] Does the code handle empty/zero/None inputs?

**Security (when applicable):**
- [ ] Is untrusted input validated before use?
- [ ] Are auth checks present on protected paths?
- [ ] Is sensitive data (keys, tokens) excluded from logs and error messages?
- [ ] Are timing-safe comparisons used for secrets?

**Patterns and conventions:**
- [ ] Does the code follow existing patterns in the codebase? (highest precedence)
- [ ] Are new types/functions placed in the right modules?
- [ ] Do public APIs have doc comments?
- [ ] Are error types specific and actionable?

**Resource management:**
- [ ] Are connections, file handles, and locks properly released?
- [ ] Are timeouts set on all I/O operations?
- [ ] Do caches/pools have bounded capacity?
- [ ] Is cleanup handled on error paths, not just success paths?

**Concurrency (when applicable):**
- [ ] Is shared state accessed through appropriate synchronization?
- [ ] Are lock scopes minimized?
- [ ] Could this deadlock? (nested locks, await while holding lock)

### Review Output Format (What the Reviewer Returns)

All review paths must produce this format. Parse it to determine your next action.

```markdown
## Code Review: [change description]

**Files reviewed:** [list]
**Iteration:** N of 3

### Findings

#### P0-001: [title]
**File:** `src/tunnel.rs:45-52`
**Issue:** [what's wrong]
**Impact:** [what happens if not fixed]
**Suggested fix:** [specific guidance, not just "fix this"]

#### P1-001: [title]
**File:** `src/auth.rs:23`
**Issue:** [what's wrong]
**Impact:** [what happens if not fixed]
**Suggested fix:** [specific guidance]

#### P2-001: [title]
**File:** `src/config.rs:100`
**Issue:** [what's wrong]
**Recommendation:** [what to improve]

### Summary
- P0: N findings (MUST fix)
- P1: N findings (MUST fix)
- P2: N findings (file issues)
- P3: N findings (file issues)
- **Verdict:** BLOCKED / PASS WITH ISSUES / CLEAN
```

### Remediation Rules

When fixing findings from the review artifact:
- Fix ONLY the cited findings. Do not refactor adjacent code.
- Do not introduce new functionality while remediating.
- If a fix requires changing the approach significantly, note this in the remediation and let the next reviewer evaluate the full new approach on the next review cycle.
- Each remediated finding should be annotated: `Fixed P0-001: [what was changed]`
- **Scope remediation reviews to only the files you touched.** Pass `--prior-review "$REVIEW_FILE"` when using Claude, or provide the prior artifact when using a fallback reviewer, so the next review can verify fixes and check for regressions without re-reviewing already-approved code:
  ```bash
  # Initial review — full scope
  REVIEW_FILE=$("$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --git -- src/parser/ src/auth.rs)

  # Remediation review — only the files you fixed, with prior review for continuity
  REVIEW_FILE=$("$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --git --prior-review "$REVIEW_FILE" -- src/auth.rs)
  ```
- If you disagree with a finding, see "Disagreeing with Review Findings" below — do not silently skip it.

---

## Loop 2: Test Writing Loop

This loop runs after the code change loop exits cleanly. It ensures the new (and existing) code has adequate test coverage.

The audit does double duty: it finds missing coverage AND flags bad tests (mirror tests, flaky assertions, etc.). A bad test doesn't close a gap, so a single audit pass catches both problems. No separate quality review step needed.

### Roles

| Role | Agent | Skill |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Auditor** | Claude preferred; non-self scripted fallback next; same-model provider last; fresh-context Codex final fallback | `diff-test-audit` keeps same-model shell-outs last; fallback auditor uses bundled references and writes an artifact |
| **Test Writer** | Codex or Gemini | Writes tests per `references/testing-standards.md` standards |

### Pragmatic Enforcement Policy

Use a hybrid gate to avoid unnecessary friction while preserving confidence:

- **Non-trivial code changes (default):** The test-writing loop is required. Do not close the loop without audit evidence from `diff-test-audit` or a fallback audit artifact, and a re-audit state with no unresolved P0/P1 gaps.
- **Trivial changes (explicit exception):** Docs-only, comments-only, formatting-only, or rename-only edits may skip the audit loop.
- **Mandatory note for skips:** Every skip must include `audit skipped: trivial` with a one-line reason in the loop summary.
- **Uncertainty rule:** If it is not clearly trivial, run the audit.

**Practical close criteria for implementer loops:**
1. Tests added or updated for the change (when behavior changed).
2. Local verification commands run and reported.
3. Audit evidence present, or explicit trivial skip note present.

### What the Audit Catches

The audit report covers both gap analysis and quality in a single pass:

**Coverage gaps (missing tests):**
- Behaviors in the public contract with no corresponding test
- Error paths with no failure test
- Edge cases (empty input, boundary values, unicode) not exercised

**Test quality issues (bad tests):**
- Mirror tests — expected values computed from implementation, not hardcoded
- Trivial assertions — `assert(true)`, assertions that can never fail
- Happy-path-only — tested behavior has no edge case or failure test
- Over-mocking — mocks at internal boundaries, not just external (network, fs, time)
- Flaky patterns — timing-dependent assertions, hardcoded ports, shared state

A bad test shows up as an unclosed gap. A mirror test for behavior X means X is still "Missing" in the gap report, not "Covered". This is why one audit pass is sufficient.

### Audit Severity

| Severity | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| P0 | Critical gap or false confidence | Missing auth test, mirror test on security path, assertion that passes with implementation deleted |
| P1 | Meaningful gap or fragile test | No error path test, happy-path-only, hardcoded port, timing-dependent assertion |
| P2 | Coverage improvement or test hygiene | Missing edge case, poor naming, verbose setup that should be a helper |

### Circuit Breaker

**Maximum iterations: 3 audit cycles** (initial audit + 2 re-audits).

If P0/P1 gaps remain after 3 cycles, escalate to human with a summary of what's proving difficult to test and why. This usually indicates the code needs refactoring to be testable — that's a design problem, not a test problem.

If Claude was unavailable for one or more audit cycles, include that fact in the
summary so humans know the audit path used.

---

## Loop 3: Lint Gate

After the test writing loop exits cleanly, run the project linter against ALL files touched across both loops. Lint fixes are code changes — they may produce deferred findings or break tests — so the lint gate runs before issue filing.

### Linter Discovery

Discover the project's linter using this cascade. Stop at the first match:

1. **Project docs** — Check `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for lint commands or conventions.
2. **Task runner targets** — Look for standard targets: `make lint`, `npm run lint`, `cargo clippy`, `./gradlew lint`, `bundle exec rubocop`, etc.
3. **Config file inference** — Match config files to linters:
   - `.eslintrc*` / `eslint.config.*` → `npx eslint`
   - `pyproject.toml [tool.ruff]` → `ruff check`
   - `pyproject.toml [tool.black]` → `black --check`
   - `.prettierrc*` → `npx prettier --check`
   - `Cargo.toml` → `cargo clippy`
   - `.rubocop.yml` → `bundle exec rubocop`
   - `.golangci.yml` → `golangci-lint run`
   - `biome.json` → `npx biome check`
4. **Fallback** — If no linter is discoverable, escalate to the user. **Never guess.**

### The Loop

```

                  │
                  └── Back to LINT CHECK
```

### What "Clean" Means

- **Zero errors** from the project linter.
- **No new warnings** introduced by your changes.
- Pre-existing warnings in unmodified files are noted but not blocking.

### Auto-fix Reference

| Linter | Check Command | Auto-fix Command |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| ESLint | `npx eslint .` | `npx eslint . --fix` |
| Ruff | `ruff check .` | `ruff check . --fix` |
| Black | `black --check .` | `black .` |
| Prettier | `npx prettier --check .` | `npx prettier --write .` |
| Clippy | `cargo clippy` | `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` |
| RuboCop | `bundle exec rubocop` | `bundle exec rubocop -A` |
| golangci-lint | `golangci-lint run` | `golangci-lint run --fix` |
| Biome | `npx biome check .` | `npx biome check . --fix` |
| rustfmt | `cargo fmt --check` | `cargo fmt` |
| gofmt | `gofmt -l .` | `gofmt -w .` |

### Auto-fix Rules

1. **Always auto-fix before manual remediation.** Auto-fix eliminates the mechanical majority.
2. **Re-run tests after auto-fix.** If auto-fix breaks tests, revert the auto-fix and remediate manually.
3. **Revert if auto-fix breaks tests.** A passing test suite takes priority over lint cleanliness.

### Circuit Breaker

**Maximum iterations: 2 lint-check cycles** (initial check + 1 re-check after remediation).

Lint is mechanical, not semantic. If you can't get clean in 2 cycles, the issue is either a misconfigured rule or a design problem:
1. Stop. Do not attempt a 3rd remediation.
2. Summarize unresolved lint errors with context on why they persist.
3. Escalate to human reviewer with the summary.

### Severity Model

Lint findings use a **binary pass/fail** model — no P0/P1/P2 triage. Lint rules are team policy: the agent complies, it doesn't judge. If a rule seems wrong, escalate to the user rather than disabling or ignoring it.

---

## Loop 4: Issue Filing Verification

Deferred findings should already have backlog items from their respective loops
(see "Deferred Findings Are Mandatory Backlog Items" above). This step verifies
completeness: check that every deferred P2/P3 from all review and audit artifacts
has a corresponding backlog item. File any that were missed.

### Backlog-First Policy

When filing deferred findings in this repository:

- If a `backlog/` folder exists at repo root **and** Backlog tooling is available (Backlog MCP tools and/or Backlog CLI), use Backlog to create tracked issues/tasks.
- Include enough context for another agent to execute without re-auditing:
  - source review/audit artifact
  - affected files/modules
  - severity and user impact
  - suggested fix direction
  - acceptance criteria
- If Backlog is not available, create a markdown handoff under `.cortex/fixes/`.
  - Prefer naming by replacing `review` with `fix` from the source artifact name (`s/review/fix/`).
  - If no review artifact name exists, use a descriptive `*-fix.md` filename.
- Implementers may also choose to fix deferred findings immediately instead of filing, when appropriate.

### Issue Template

```markdown
## [P2/P3] [Module]: [Brief description]

**Source:** [Code Review / Test Audit] iteration N
**Severity:** P2 | P3
**Module:** [file path]

### Description
[What's missing or what could be improved]

### Context
[Why this was deferred — not blocking but worth addressing]

### Suggested approach
[Brief guidance on how to address]

### Acceptance criteria
[How to verify this is done]
```

### Filing Rules

- One issue per finding. Do not batch unrelated findings.
- P2 issues get the label `quality` or `test-gap` as appropriate.
- P3 issues get the label `improvement`.
- Issues from test audits reference the specific behavior from the gap report.
- Issues include enough context that a different agent (or human) can pick them up without re-auditing.

---

## Operational Notes

### Agent Responsibilities Summary

**You (Codex / Gemini) are responsible for:**
- Reading and understanding the task spec
- Decomposing the task into atomic commits (one logical change each)
- Writing implementation code — one atomic commit at a time
- Writing test code
- Running the full test suite before every commit
- Using `cortex git commit` for all commits (not `git commit`) unless explicitly approved otherwise
- Committing at the end of every loop exit (code change, test writing, lint gate)
- Running `"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/specialist-review.sh" --git -- <your-files>` after implementation; on remediation cycles, scope to remediated files and pass `--prior-review "$REVIEW_FILE"`
- Running `"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff-test-audit.sh" <module> --git` (diff-scoped) for initial audit and each re-audit; reach for the `test-review` skill if you need a full module audit instead
- Preserving fallback review/audit artifacts in `.cortex/reviews/` when Claude is unavailable
- Falling back to another model family before the same-model last resort when Claude is unavailable
- Fixing ONLY the findings the independent review/audit artifact identifies (no scope creep during remediation)
- Discovering and running the project linter after both loops exit
- Running auto-fix first, then manually fixing remaining lint issues
- Verifying tests still pass after lint fixes
- Escalating if lint cannot be resolved in 2 cycles
- Filing P2/P3 issues when loop exits
- Escalating when circuit breaker triggers

**You are NOT responsible for:**
- Reviewing your own code (an independent reviewer does this)
- Judging your own test coverage or quality (an independent auditor does this)
- Deciding whether a finding is valid (if you disagree, note it in the remediation and let the next review re-evaluate — do not silently skip findings)

### Disagreeing with Review Findings

If the reviewer flags something you believe is incorrect:
1. Do NOT silently ignore the finding.
2. In your remediation response, explicitly state: `Disputed P1-003: [your reasoning]`
3. Run the next review pass with the dispute noted in your commit/changes or fallback review materials.
4. The next review pass will either accept your reasoning or reaffirm the finding with additional context.
5. If still disputed after 2 cycles, escalate to human — do not loop forever on a disagreement.

### What "Escalate to Human" Means

When the circuit breaker triggers:
1. Stop all loops.
2. Produce a structured summary:
   - What was attempted
   - What findings remain unresolved
   - Why they persist (agent's best assessment)
   - Recommended human action
3. Do not attempt creative workarounds to avoid escalation.

### Metrics (Track If Tooling Supports)

Per loop run:
- Number of iterations before exit
- Findings by severity per iteration
- Number of findings that regressed (fixed then reappeared)
- Time per iteration
- Circuit breaker activations

These metrics help tune the loop — if you're consistently hitting 3 iterations, either the review checklist is too strict or the implementer instructions need work.
