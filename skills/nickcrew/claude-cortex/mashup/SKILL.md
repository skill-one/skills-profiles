# `/collaboration:mashup`

Use when you want fresh UX/GT ideas by blending unrelated domains.

## Inputs
- Topic/problem
- Domains to borrow from (flags or let it randomize)
- Any constraints to respect

## Steps
1. Pick 2–3 orthogonal domains (fintech, gaming, health, etc.).
2. Lift 1–2 patterns per domain (loyalty loops, streaks, rituals, marketplace dynamics).
3. Create 3 mashup concepts with user journey sketch, differentiator, risk, first experiment.
4. Label one bold bet and one safe bet.
5. Hand off to `/ctx:plan` or add Tasks for the experiments.

## Output Template
```
### Domains & Patterns
### Mashup Concepts (3)
- Concept … (journey, differentiator, risk, first experiment)
### Bold Bet / Safe Bet
### Next Experiments
```

## Pairings
- Combine with `/collaboration:assumption-buster` to widen the idea pool.
- Use `/collaboration:concept-forge` to score the mashups.
