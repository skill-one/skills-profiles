# Documentation Claim Validator

Verify that what documentation *says* is actually *true* by extracting testable claims
and checking them against the codebase. Complements `doc-maintenance` (which handles
structural health) by handling **semantic accuracy**.

## When to Use

- After significant code changes (refactors, renames, API changes)
- Before releases — catch docs that describe removed or changed behavior
- When onboarding devs report "the docs are wrong"
- As a periodic trust audit on project documentation
- After running `doc-maintenance` to go deeper than structural checks

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1: Extract    → Pull verifiable claims from docs (deterministic script)
Phase 2: Verify     → Check claims against codebase (automated + AI)
Phase 3: Report     → Classify failures by severity and type
Phase 4: Remediate  → Fix or flag broken claims
```

---

## Phase 1: Extract Claims

Run the extraction script to parse all markdown files and pull out verifiable assertions:

```bash
python3 skills/doc-claim-validator/scripts/extract_claims.py [--json] [--root PATH] [--scope docs|manual|all]
```

The script extracts these claim types from markdown:

| Type | What it captures | Example in docs |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `file_path` | Inline code matching file path patterns | `` `src/auth/login.ts` `` |
| `command` | Code blocks or inline code with shell commands | `` `npm run build` `` |
| `code_ref` | Function, class, method references in inline code | `` `authenticate()` `` |
| `import` | Import/require statements in code blocks | `import { Router } from 'express'` |
| `config` | Configuration keys, env vars, settings | `` `MAX_RETRIES=3` `` |
| `url` | External links (http/https) | `[docs](https://example.com)` |
| `architectural` | Verb-anchored prose claims about technology, integrations, or architectural patterns | "Uses Redis for caching", "follows the actor model", "delegated to Auth0" |
| `dependency` | Package/library name claims | "Uses Redis for caching" |
| `behavioral` | Assertions about what code does | "The system retries 3 times" |

The first 7 types are extracted deterministically. The script uses verb-anchored
regex for `architectural` (rules like `uses X`, `built with X`, `follows the X
pattern`, `delegated to X`, `via X`, `depends on X`) — this catches anchorless
prose claims that previously slipped through.

The last 2 (`dependency`, `behavioral`) require AI analysis and are handled in
Phase 2. `behavioral` in particular is *not* regex-extracted because behavioral
claims are free-form prose ("the cache invalidates when the user logs out")
that doesn't pattern-match cleanly — the behavioral verifier discovers and
verifies them in one pass.

**Output:** A structured list of claims with source file, line number, claim type, and the literal
text of the claim.

---

## Phase 2: Verify Claims

### Step 2a — Automated verification

Run the verification script on the extracted claims:

```bash
python3 skills/doc-claim-validator/scripts/verify_claims.py [--json] [--root PATH] [--claims-file PATH] [--check-staleness]
```

Pass `--check-staleness` to enable git-based drift analysis (see below).

The script checks each claim type differently:

| Claim type | Verification method | Pass condition |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| `file_path` | `os.path.exists()` | File exists at referenced path |
| `command` | `shutil.which()` + script check | Binary exists or script file exists |
| `code_ref` | `grep -r` for function/class name | Symbol found in codebase |
| `import` | Check module exists in project or deps | Module resolvable |
| `config` | Grep for config key in source | Key found in config files or code |
| `url` | HTTP HEAD request (optional, off by default) | Returns 2xx/3xx |

Pass `--check-urls` to enable URL verification (slow, requires network).

### Step 2b — AI-assisted verification

After the automated pass, dispatch agents to verify claims the script cannot.
Three of four verifiers run on `general-purpose` + `sonnet` — behavioral,
architectural, and code-example verification all require multi-file reasoning
that haiku's excerpt-read pattern strains under. The dependency verifier stays
on `Explore` + `haiku` because it's pure pattern matching against manifest
files.

#### Dispatch strategy: per-docfile batching

For behavioral and architectural verifiers, dispatch **one sonnet call per
markdown file containing claims of that type**, with all claims from that file
batched into a single prompt. This keeps each call's context budget on a small
number of related claims (cross-referencing within the doc improves
verification) while keeping total call count tied to doc-set size rather than
claim count. For a project with ~50 docs and ~150 architectural claims, expect
~10–20 sonnet calls (only docs with claims trigger calls), not 150.

For release audits where precision matters more than cost, run with
**per-claim dispatch** — one sonnet call per claim, each with the full doc as
context. Higher cost, higher precision.

#### Verifiers

**Verifier 1 — Dependency claim verifier** (`subagent_type: "Explore"`,
`model: "haiku"`):
Read `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, or equivalent
dependency manifests. Cross-reference any doc claims about libraries,
frameworks, or services used. Report claims that reference dependencies not in
the project. Stays on haiku because pattern-matching against manifests doesn't
benefit from sonnet's reasoning.

**Verifier 2 — Behavioral claim verifier** (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`,
`model: "sonnet"`, **per-docfile**):
For each markdown file in scope, dispatch a sonnet agent with the file content.
The agent (a) discovers behavioral claims in the file ("retries 3 times",
"caches for 5 minutes", "validates input before processing", "the cache
invalidates when the user logs out"), (b) finds the relevant code via grep /
codanna / `Read`, (c) verifies whether the claim matches the implementation.
Report each claim with confirmed / contradicted / unverifiable / conditional
status. Sonnet is needed because behavioral verification often requires
tracing across multiple files (handler → middleware → config) and
distinguishing happy-path from error-path behavior.

**Verifier 3 — Architectural claim verifier** (`subagent_type:
"general-purpose"`, `model: "sonnet"`, **per-docfile**):
For each markdown file with extracted `architectural` claims, dispatch a
sonnet agent with the file content and the list of pre-extracted claims. The
agent verifies each claim by:
- For `uses`/`built`/`depends`/`via` frames: check the named technology in
  dependency manifests, config files, and source imports.
- For `delegated` frames: check for SDK imports or HTTP integrations matching
  the named service.
- For `follows`/`uses_pattern` frames: check directory structure, class names,
  and code organization for the named architectural pattern (e.g., CQRS:
  separate command/query handlers + event store; hexagonal: adapters/ports
  dirs; saga: orchestrator class with named transitions).

Report each claim with confirmed / contradicted / unverifiable / conditional
status. Sonnet is needed because architectural patterns aren't 1:1 with any
single file — verification requires reading enough of the codebase to
recognize the pattern.

**Verifier 4 — Code example verifier** (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`,
`model: "sonnet"`, **per-docfile**):
For code blocks in docs that show usage examples, verify the function
signatures, parameter names, return types, and import paths match the current
codebase. Report examples that would fail if copy-pasted. Sonnet is needed
because signature checking requires reading the *current* implementation and
comparing — haiku's excerpt reads aren't sufficient.

Launch verifiers 1, 2, 3, 4 in parallel. Within verifiers 2/3/4, the per-docfile
dispatches run sequentially (or in small parallel batches if cost permits).

### Step 2c — Git staleness scoring

For claims that **pass** existence checks, compute a drift score to surface likely-stale claims:

```bash
python3 skills/doc-claim-validator/scripts/verify_claims.py --check-staleness
```

For each passing claim, the script:
1. Gets the doc file's last git modification timestamp
2. Gets the target file(s) last git modification timestamp
3. Counts how many commits touched the target *after* the doc was last edited
4. Assigns a drift score: low (1-3 commits), medium (4-9), high (10+)

High-drift claims are the best candidates for AI review — the target changed heavily
but the doc didn't, so the doc is probably describing outdated behavior.

The staleness report is appended as a ranked table, sorted by score descending.

---

## Phase 3: Report

Merge automated and AI findings into a single report. Classify each failed claim:

### Severity

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **P0** | User-facing doc claims something that would break if followed | Tutorial shows deleted API endpoint |
| **P1** | Dev doc references nonexistent code construct | README references `auth.validate()` which was renamed |
| **P2** | Behavioral claim no longer accurate | "Retries 3 times" but retry logic was removed |
| **P3** | Dependency/import claim outdated | "Uses Express" but migrated to Fastify |
| **P4** | Minor inaccuracy, cosmetic | Config key renamed but behavior unchanged |

### Failure Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `missing_target` | Referenced file, function, or symbol doesn't exist |
| `wrong_signature` | Function exists but signature differs from doc |
| `stale_behavior` | Behavioral claim doesn't match implementation |
| `dead_dependency` | Doc references a dependency not in the project |
| `phantom_pattern` | Architectural claim ("uses CQRS", "follows actor model") not evidenced in the codebase |
| `wrong_integration` | Doc names a service/SDK ("delegated to Auth0") that isn't actually integrated |
| `broken_example` | Code example would fail if executed |
| `dead_url` | External link returns 4xx/5xx |
| `phantom_config` | Config option referenced in docs doesn't exist in code |

---

## Phase 4: Remediate

For each failed claim, decide the action:

| Action | When | How |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Update doc** | Code is correct, doc is stale | Edit doc to match code |
| **Flag for review** | Unclear if code or doc is wrong | Create issue for human review |
| **Remove claim** | Referenced feature was deleted | Remove or rewrite section |
| **Update example** | Code example is outdated | Rewrite example against current code |

Route remediation to the appropriate agent per `doc-maintenance` conventions:
- `reference-builder` for API/CLI reference docs
- `technical-writer` for architecture and developer docs
- `learning-guide` for user-facing tutorials and guides

---

## Integration with doc-maintenance

This skill is designed to run **after** `doc-maintenance`:

```
doc-maintenance  →  Structural health (links, orphans, folders, staleness)
doc-claim-validator  →  Semantic accuracy (do claims match reality?)
```

The two skills share the same severity scale and remediation agent routing. Results from
both can be combined into a single documentation health report.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not auto-fix behavioral claims — they require human judgment about intent
- Do not treat every inline code reference as a file path (`` `true` `` is not a file)
- Do not validate claims in archived docs (`docs/archive/`) — they're historical
- Do not fail on optional/conditional features — mark as "conditional" instead
- Do not check URLs by default — it's slow and flaky; opt-in only
- Do not validate code blocks marked with `<!-- no-verify -->` comment
