name: mlb-data
description: |
  MLB data via ESPN public endpoints and the official MLB Stats API — scores, standings, rosters, schedules, game summaries, injuries, leaders, and news, plus an analytics backend: pitch-level velocity/spin/exit-velocity, career splits by stat group, league leaders, and schedules to 1901. Zero config, no API keys.

  Use when: user asks about MLB scores, standings, team rosters, schedules, game stats, box scores, play-by-play, injuries, transactions, depth charts, team/player statistics, MLB news, pitch speeds/spin/exit velocity, career stats, league leaders, or historical MLB seasons.
  Don't use when: user asks about minor league baseball, college baseball, or international baseball. For other sports use: nfl-data (NFL), nba-data (NBA), wnba-data (WNBA), nhl-data (NHL), football-data (soccer), tennis-data (tennis), golf-data (golf), cricket-data (cricket), cfb-data (college football), cbb-data (college basketball), fastf1 (F1). For betting odds use polymarket or kalshi. For news use sports-news.

# MLB Data

Before writing queries, consult `references/api-reference.md` for endpoints, ID conventions, and data shapes.

## Setup

Before first use, check if the CLI is available:
```bash
which sports-skills || pip install sports-skills
```
If `pip install` fails with a Python version error, the package requires Python 3.10+. Find a compatible Python:
```bash
python3 --version  # check version
# If < 3.10, try: python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
# On macOS with Homebrew: /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
```
No API keys required.

## Quick Start

Prefer the CLI — it avoids Python import path issues:
```bash
sports-skills mlb get_scoreboard
sports-skills mlb get_standings --season=2025
sports-skills mlb get_teams
```

## CRITICAL: Before Any Query

CRITICAL: Before calling any data endpoint, verify:
- Season year is derived from the system prompt's `currentDate` — never hardcoded.
- If only a team name is provided, call `get_teams` to resolve the team ID before using team-specific commands.

## Choosing the Season

Derive the active season from the system prompt's date — not just the calendar year.

- **If the user specifies a season**, use it as-is.
- **If the user says "current", "this season", or doesn't specify**: The MLB season runs late March/April through October. If the current month is January–March, the last completed season was the prior calendar year. From April onward, use the current calendar year.

See `references/api-reference.md` for full parameter lists and return shapes.

## Shaping Play-by-Play Results

`get_mlbstats_play_by_play` accepts `sort_by`, `descending`, `limit` and `fields`.
`fields` is the quickest way to drop the per-pitch lists when you only need the
at-bat outcomes:

```bash
sports-skills mlb get_mlbstats_play_by_play --game_pk=775296 --fields=event,rbi
```

- `sort_by`: one column to sort by. Numbers (and numeric strings) sort numerically; missing values always go last.
- `descending`: `true` (default) or `false`; only used with `sort_by`.
- `limit`: positive integer, applied after sorting.
- `fields`: comma-separated keep-list. `inning`, `half`, `batter`, `pitcher` and the `sort_by` column are always kept.
- An unknown `sort_by`/`fields` column returns an error listing the valid columns.
- With any of these set, the response adds `total_rows` (matching rows before `limit`) and `returned_rows`. With none set, output is unchanged. They are applied after the fetch, so they never change the upstream request or its replay entry.

## Using ESPN and the MLB Stats API Together

The `get_mlbstats_*` commands read statsapi.mlb.com — MLB's own open API. It
carries the analytics layer ESPN does not: per-pitch velocity/spin/location,
exit velocity and launch angle on balls in play, career splits by stat group,
and schedules back to 1901. The two sources use unrelated id systems:

- **Game ids.** MLB uses `gamePk` (e.g. `775296`); ESPN uses event ids
  (e.g. `401570367`). No shared column — join on the game date plus teams.
- **Team abbreviations.** Two teams differ: ESPN `ARI`/`CHW` vs MLB `AZ`/`CWS`.
  Every `get_mlbstats_*` team filter accepts either spelling, and rows carry
  both (`team_abbreviation`, `team_abbreviation_espn`).
- **Player ids.** MLB person ids (`660271`) and ESPN athlete ids are unrelated.
  Resolve names with `find_mlb_player`; ASCII spellings match accented names
  ("acuna" finds "Ronald Acuña Jr.").
- **Postponed games repeat.** A postponed or suspended game is listed twice
  under one `game_pk` in `get_mlbstats_schedule`: the original date has
  `rescheduled: true` (and `rescheduled_to`), the make-up has
  `rescheduled_from`. Drop `rescheduled` rows when counting games.
- **Leaders come grouped.** A category like `homeRuns` exists for hitting,
  catching, and pitching (home runs *allowed*); rows are labelled with
  `stat_group` — pass `stat_group=` to get just one.

Responses include MLB's `copyright` notice, passed through from the API.

## Commands that DO NOT exist — never call these

- ~~`get_odds`~~ / ~~`get_betting_odds`~~ — not available. For prediction market odds, use the polymarket or kalshi skill.
- ~~`search_teams`~~ — does not exist. Use `get_teams` instead.
- ~~`get_box_score`~~ — does not exist. Use `get_game_summary` instead.
- ~~`get_player_ratings`~~ — does not exist. Use `get_player_stats` instead.

If a command is not listed in the Commands table above, it does not exist.

## Error Handling

When a command fails, **do not surface raw errors to the user**. Instead:
1. Catch silently and try alternatives
2. If team name given instead of ID, use `get_teams` to find the ID first
3. Only report failure with a clean message after exhausting alternatives

## Troubleshooting

Error: `sports-skills` command not found
Cause: Package not installed
Solution: Run `pip install sports-skills`

Error: Team not found by ID
Cause: Wrong or outdated ESPN team ID used
Solution: Call `get_teams` to get the current list of all 30 MLB teams with their IDs

Error: No data returned for a future game
Cause: ESPN only returns data for completed or in-progress games
Solution: Use `get_schedule` to see upcoming game details; `get_scoreboard` only covers active/recent games

Error: Offseason — scoreboard returns 0 events
Cause: No games scheduled during the offseason (November–March)
Solution: Use `get_standings` or `get_news` instead; MLB offseason transactions are available via `get_transactions`
