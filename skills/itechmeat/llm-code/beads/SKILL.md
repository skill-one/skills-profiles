# Beads (bd)

Distributed, Dolt-backed (Git-like) graph issue tracker for AI coding agents. Persistent memory with dependency-aware task tracking.

## Quick Start

Install: `brew install beads` or use the install scripts/binaries from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads).

```bash
# Initialize in repo (humans run once)
bd init

# Tell your agent
echo "Use 'bd' for task tracking" >> AGENTS.md
```

## When to Use

- AI agent needs persistent task memory across sessions
- Tracking dependencies between tasks (`blocks:`, `depends_on:`)
- Multi-agent/multi-branch workflows (hash-based IDs prevent conflicts)
- Incremental delivery with molecules/gates
- Sync issues with GitLab, Linear, Jira, GitHub

## Hash-Based IDs

Issues use hash-based IDs like `bd-a1b2` to prevent merge conflicts:

```bash
bd create "Fix login bug" -p 1
# Created: bd-x7k3

bd show bd-x7k3
```

### Hierarchical IDs

```
bd-a3f8      (Epic)
bd-a3f8.1    (Task)
bd-a3f8.1.1  (Sub-task)
```

Use `bd children <id>` to view hierarchy.

## Key Concepts

### Dolt as Database

Beads stores issues in a Dolt database. Team synchronization happens via Dolt-style
`pull`/`push`, not by committing JSONL files into your repo history.

### Dependency Graph

```bash
bd dep add bd-child bd-parent --blocks   # child blocks parent
bd dep add bd-a bd-b --related           # related items
bd ready                                 # only shows unblocked work
```

### Molecules (Advanced)

Molecules group related issues with gates for incremental delivery:

```bash
bd mol create "Feature X" --steps=3      # Create 3-step molecule
bd mol progress bd-xyz                   # Check progress
bd mol burn bd-xyz                       # Complete molecule
```

### Stealth Mode

Use Beads locally without committing to repo:

```bash
bd init --stealth
```

### Contributor vs Maintainer

```bash
# Contributor (forked repos) — separate planning repo
bd init --contributor

# Maintainer auto-detected via SSH/HTTPS credentials
```

## Configuration

Config stored in `.beads/config.yaml`:

The exact schema evolves between releases. Prefer using CLI helpers to inspect
and validate your current setup:

- `bd dolt show` to see current Dolt connection/remote settings
- `bd dolt test` to validate connectivity
- `bd doctor` / `bd doctor --deep` for health checks

## Storage Backend (Dolt)

Beads uses Dolt as its primary backend. Depending on your setup, Dolt can run:

- Embedded (single-writer, no daemon)
- Server mode (multi-writer)

Use `bd doctor` (and `bd doctor --server` when applicable) to validate your
environment. For legacy stores, use `bd migrate` workflows.

## Agent Integration

### Tell Agent About Beads

Add to `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Task Tracking

Use `bd` for task tracking. Run `bd ready` to find work.
```

### Agent-Optimized Output

```bash
BD_AGENT_MODE=1 bd list --json  # Ultra-compact JSON output
bd list --json                   # Standard JSON output
```

### MCP Plugin

Beads includes Claude Code MCP plugin for direct integration.

## Release Highlights (1.2.2)

- **Recovery release**: v1.2.0/v1.2.1 were published without release testing; v1.2.2 re-releases the tested 1.1 line under a higher version, so every install channel moves onto tested code. The 1.2.x-only features (work leases, events journal, sync federation, HTTP API server, provenance events) are **not** in this release — they return in a tested future release.
- **If you ran v1.2.1** and hit `schema version mismatch: database is at v65, binary knows up to v53`: roll the schema cursor back to v53 (see `docs/RECOVERY-1.2.1.md`), or use the `BD_IGNORE_SCHEMA_SKEW=1` stopgap — see `references/sync.md`. Upgrade every machine/clone to v1.2.2 **before** recovering, or a leftover 1.2.1 binary will silently re-migrate the database.

## Release Highlights (1.1.0)

- **Safer migrations**: schema-change detection so database migrations no longer apply silently, plus read-only enforcement across all layers.
- **Sync repair**: repair for previously problematic pull merges, and compaction now archives before discarding information.
- **New commands/flags**: `bd metrics` (with a consent notice) and idempotent `--init-if-missing` initialization.

## Release Highlights (1.0.3–1.0.4)

- **Workflow/config ergonomics**: `bd -C` changes working directory before running, `bd close` gains `--reason-file`, and setup/bootstrap flows gain better remote/server config handling.
- **Linear sync**: OAuth client-credentials, idempotency markers, stale-data signaling, per-workspace sync locks, richer type mappings, and batch create/update make larger sync loops safer and faster.
- **Security/export defaults**: Beads now refuses to write secret keys into git-tracked config, and exports exclude memories and ephemeral wisps by default unless you opt back in.
- **Dependencies/data paths**: JSONL bulk dependency add and several hook/bootstrap/init fixes reduce friction in automated and shared-server environments.

## Release Highlights (1.0.0–1.0.2)

- **Distribution**: precompiled binaries now cover Linux, macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), Windows (AMD64/ARM64), Android/Termux, and FreeBSD.
- **Automation**: `bd init --non-interactive` / `--role` and `bd bootstrap --non-interactive` improve CI/cloud-agent setup.
- **Workflow**: `bd ready --explain`, `bd config set-many`, batch dependency listing, and comma-separated status filters improve agent ergonomics.
- **Authoring/modeling**: `spike`, `story`, and `milestone` are now first-class issue types; custom statuses/types moved to normalized tables.
- **Integrations/sync**: GitLab sync adds better dedup + epic→milestone mapping, ADO sync respects more filters, and embedded/shared-server recovery got safer.

## Release Highlights (0.62.0–0.63.3)

- **Azure DevOps integration**: `bd ado` CLI commands (sync, status, projects) for work item tracking.
- **Embedded Dolt support**: dep, duplicate, epic, graph, supersede, swarm operations work without a running Dolt server.
- **Custom status categories**: configure active/wip/done/frozen status groupings.
- **`bd note` command**: shorthand for appending notes to issues.
- **`--exclude-type` flag**: filter by issue type on `bd ready` and `bd list`.
- **`--format json` alias**: alternative to `--json` flag for consistency.
- **Audit log**: captures close reason; status changes logged to `interactions.jsonl`.
- **Memories in export/import**: round-trip includes agent memories.
- **Init defaults**: AGENTS.md defaults to minimal profile; `--agents-profile` flag added.
- **Quality/lifecycle commands**: surfaced in prime, template, and doctor.
- **Validation on close**: `--validate` checks `--acceptance` field; `validation.on-close` config.

## Release Highlights (0.61.0)

- `bd close --claim-next` shortens the common close-and-claim-next loop for agents.
- `bd create` gains `--skills`, `--context`, and `--no-history` for richer task creation and optional Dolt-history suppression.
- `bd import` adds incremental JSONL import for portability and recovery workflows.
- `bd init` / `bd bootstrap` can auto-detect the Beads database from the repository git origin.
- Dolt/server-mode sync improves credential pass-through, runtime port reporting, and health checks.
- Config and backup handling are safer, including proper project+user config merge and `BD_BACKUP_ENABLED=false` support.

## Critical Commands

```bash
# What to work on
bd ready                    # Unblocked tasks
bd ready --pretty           # Formatted output

# Create with dependencies
bd create "Task B" --blocks bd-a1b2
bd create "Task C" --context "Need schema review" --skills "python,sql"

# Doctor (fix issues)
bd doctor                   # Check health
bd doctor --fix             # Auto-fix problems

bd sync                     # Sync DB state
bd import -i backup.jsonl   # Incremental JSONL import

bd dolt pull                # Pull latest changes (advanced)
bd dolt push                # Push to remote (advanced)
```

## Anti-patterns

| ❌ Wrong              | ✅ Correct                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `priority: high`      | `-p 1` (P0-P4 numeric)      |
| Manual JSON editing   | Use `bd` commands           |
| Ignoring `bd ready`   | Always check blockers first |
| Skipping `bd sync`    | Sync before/after work      |
| Creating without deps | Declare `--blocks` upfront  |
