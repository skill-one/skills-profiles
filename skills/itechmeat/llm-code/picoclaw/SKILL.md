# PicoClaw

PicoClaw is an ultra-lightweight AI assistant written in Go. This skill is a practical operator playbook for running the CLI, configuring `~/.picoclaw/config.json`, and operating `gateway` + channels.

- Troubleshooting: `references/troubleshooting.md`

## When to use

Use when you need to:

- Bootstrap PicoClaw on a host (onboard → config → run)
- Switch providers/models via `model_list`
- Run the agent in CLI mode or operate `gateway`
- Enable chat channels (Telegram/Discord/Slack/WeCom/...)
- Send outbound notifications to Microsoft Teams via webhook targets
- Configure tools (web search, exec deny patterns, skills registries)
- Install/remove skills into the workspace
- Use skill channel commands (`/list skills`, `/use <skill>`)
- Configure hook system (observers, interceptors, approvers)
- Configure agent bindings (route messages to different agents)
- Schedule recurring jobs (cron)

## Recipes

### 1) Initialize + verify

- Create initial config and workspace templates:
  - `picoclaw onboard`
- Verify what’s configured:
  - `picoclaw status`

### 2) Chat from CLI

- One-shot:
  - `picoclaw agent -m "Hello"`
- Interactive:
  - `picoclaw agent`

### 3) Run gateway (channels + cron + health)

- Start gateway:
  - `picoclaw gateway`
- Debug logs:
  - `picoclaw gateway --debug`

### 4) Manage auth

- OpenAI OAuth (optionally device-code for headless):
  - `picoclaw auth login --provider openai`
  - `picoclaw auth login --provider openai --device-code`
- Google Antigravity OAuth:
  - `picoclaw auth login --provider google-antigravity`
- Check status / list models:
  - `picoclaw auth status`
  - `picoclaw auth models`

### 5) Install skills

- List installed skills:
  - `picoclaw skills list`
- Install from GitHub repo slug:
  - `picoclaw skills install sipeed/picoclaw-skills/weather`
- Install from registry:
  - `picoclaw skills install --registry clawhub github`

### 6) Add a scheduled job

- Create a cron job:
  - `picoclaw cron add --name "Daily report" --cron "0 9 * * *" --message "Summarize my inbox"`
- List jobs:
  - `picoclaw cron list`

## Critical safety notes

- Do not commit real API keys or OAuth tokens into a repo; keep them in `~/.picoclaw/` only.
- Be cautious enabling the exec tool; keep deny patterns enabled unless you fully trust the environment.
- Exposing gateway to `0.0.0.0` makes health endpoints reachable from the network; do that only intentionally.

## Release Highlights (v0.2.8)

- **MCP operations**: PicoClaw now exposes first-class MCP management commands (`show`, `add`, `list`, `remove`, `test`, `edit`) and surfaces init/lifecycle failures more clearly.
- **Custom endpoints + tools**: CLI/config flows add better support for custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints and a cross-platform serial hardware tool.
- **Chat/web feedback**: tool-call visibility, animated tool feedback, restart prompts, and reasoning visibility are more consistent across Pico web/chat surfaces and channels.

## Release Highlights (v0.2.9)

- **MCP and config UI**: the config web UI adds an MCP section, MCP streamable HTTP support is fixed, Gemini MCP schema sanitization is hardened, and v3 config format sync docs/flows were refreshed.
- **Tool feedback and edit UX**: `tool_feedback` defaults add `pretty_print` and `disable_escape_html`, parent-session tool feedback cleanup is fixed, and edit-file diff previews improve review before applying generated edits.
- **Channels and voice**: Slack webhook channel support lands, Telegram media groups/SVG media handling improves, queued voice follow-ups and voice media store reload behavior are fixed, and `stop` command / MQTT channel handling are tightened.
- **Provider/runtime fixes**: Bedrock streaming, DeepSeek vision unsupported errors, DeepSeek/Mimo reasoning replay, network-error retry, and factory reset flows were improved.

## Release Highlights (v0.2.6)

- **Hooks `respond` action**: `before_tool` hooks can now return a final tool result directly, which is useful for plugin-style tools, caching, or policy-controlled mocks without registering a native tool implementation.
- **Teams outbound channel**: `teams_webhook` adds an output-only Microsoft Teams path with named webhook targets and Adaptive Card rendering for richer notifications.
- **Provider request shaping**: `model_list[].custom_headers` lets you inject extra HTTP headers per model entry, and fallback resolution now uses each fallback candidate's own provider settings.
- **Gateway/web reliability**: PID ownership/stale-pid handling was hardened, and the web UI now derives its WebSocket endpoint from the browser-visible location instead of backend assumptions.
- **Channel polish**: Feishu reply context was improved for card/file replies, reducing broken follow-up threading in that connector.

## Release Highlights (v0.2.4)

- **Hook system**: in-process and out-of-process hooks (JSON-RPC over stdio) with observer, LLM interceptor, tool interceptor, and tool approver stages. Configurable via `hooks` in config.
- **Agent bindings**: route incoming messages to different agents by channel/account/context via `bindings` config section.
- **Skill channel commands**: `/list skills`, `/use <skill> <message>`, `/use <skill>` (arm for next message), `/use clear`.
- **Configurable log level**: `gateway.log_level` (debug/info/warn/error/fatal) in config or `PICOCLAW_LOG_LEVEL` env var.
- **Voice transcription model**: `voice.model_name` lets you use any multimodal model for audio transcription; Groq Whisper remains as fallback.
- **Security config separation**: `.security.yml` file for storing API keys/tokens separate from `config.json`.
- **Workspace file hot-reload**: `AGENT.md`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md` are auto-detected via mtime tracking — no restart needed.
- SubTurn error handling and logging improved. Security config precedence fixed during migration.
