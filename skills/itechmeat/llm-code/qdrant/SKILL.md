# Qdrant (Skill Router)

This file is intentionally **introductory**.

It acts as a **router**: based on your situation, open the right note under `references/`.

## Release Highlights (1.19.0 → 1.19.1)

- **TurboQuant 4-bit as primary storage:** the `"turbo4"` datatype stores only 4-bit quantized vectors, sparing disk space on originals.
- **Per-component memory strategy:** collection components now take `"memory": "cold" / "cached" / "pinned"` for fine-grained control over memory vs performance. Deprecates `max_resident_memory_percent` of strict mode in favor of the new global quota API.
- **Keyword prefix match:** `{"match": {"prefix": "..."}}` in filters matches keywords by prefix; must be enabled in the keyword index.
- **Sparse search:** per-query IDF corpus for better per-tenant/sparse ranking.
- **Slice filtering:** sliced scroll / deterministic sampling via a slice filter condition.
- **Global quota API:** central place to cap cluster resource usage (supersedes the strict-mode memory ceiling).
- **Routing token:** deterministic read routes when the read affinity option is in use.
- **1.19.1:** 4-bit TurboQuant SIMD rework and batched HNSW searches (faster scoring), quantized scoring prefetch, plus input hardening — rejects empty dense vectors, vectors larger than 65536, and `.`/`..` in collection names (security).

## Release Highlights (1.16.3 → 1.18.0)

- **Monitoring + ops:** new APIs for optimization progress/stages and cluster-wide telemetry, plus a dedicated HTTP port option for `/metrics`.
- **Security:** audit access logging and secondary API key support (rotation).
- **Retrieval:** relevance feedback and Weighted RRF for hybrid ranking.
- **Write semantics:** `update_mode` for upserts (`upsert` / `update` / `insert`).
- **1.18.0:** TurboQuant adds an aggressive vector-compression path, collections can add/delete named vectors in place, and operators get low-memory/strict-memory knobs plus deeper memory reporting.

## Patch Notes (1.18.1 → 1.18.2)

- **1.18.2 security:** fixes a REST auth whitelist bypass on specially crafted paths and a heap-read vulnerability with malformed snapshots. Upgrade promptly if Qdrant is exposed with auth/whitelisting or accepts uploaded snapshots.
- **1.18.2:** logs slow operations during shard WAL recovery and clears the ID-tracker cache after building segments.
- Filter behavior is corrected for indexed integer range filters that receive float values and for `{match: {except: []}}` on payload-indexed fields.
- Empty vector requests no longer trigger a panic path; treat them as invalid input and validate caller-side before sending them to Qdrant.
- TurboQuant heap-memory reporting is more accurate, so operators should trust current metrics over older baselines when checking compression impact.
- Snapshot upload authorization is tightened; do not assume restore/upload endpoints are safe without the same auth review you apply to the main API surface.

## Breaking / Upgrade Notes (1.17.0)

- **gRPC clients:** response format for vector fields changed in gRPC. Upgrade official Qdrant client libraries and validate any custom gRPC integrations.
- **Storage upgrades:** RocksDB is removed in favor of gridstore. If you are on v1.15.x, do not upgrade directly to v1.17.x — upgrade one minor version at a time.

## Additional Upgrade Notes (1.18.0)

- Internal gRPC endpoints now enforce API key/JWT authentication when auth is enabled; validate internal service-to-service traffic before upgrade if you previously relied on private-network-only trust.
- Snapshot restore from URL can now be disabled by config, which is relevant for hardened/self-hosted environments.

## Start here (fast)

- New to Qdrant? Read: `references/concepts.md`.
- Want the fastest local validation? Read: `references/quickstart.md` + `references/deployment.md`.
- Integrating with Python? Read: `references/api-clients.md`.

## Choose by situation

### Data modeling

- What should go into vectors vs payload vs your main DB? Read: `references/modeling.md`.
- Working with IDs, upserts, and write semantics? Read: `references/points.md`.
- Need to understand payload types and update modes? Read: `references/payload.md`.

### Retrieval (search)

- One consolidated entry point (search + filtering + explore + hybrid): `references/retrieval.md`.

### Performance & indexing

- Index types and tradeoffs: `references/indexing.md`.
- Storage/optimizer internals that matter operationally: `references/storage.md` + `references/optimizer.md`.
- Practical tuning, monitoring, troubleshooting: `references/ops-checklist.md`.

### Deployment & ops

- Installation/Docker/Kubernetes: `references/deployment.md`.
- Configuration layering: `references/configuration.md`.
- Security/auth/TLS boundary: `references/security.md`.
- Backup/restore: `references/snapshots.md`.

### API interface choice

- REST vs gRPC, Python SDK: `references/api-clients.md`.

## How to maintain this skill

- Keep `SKILL.md` short (router + usage guidance).
- Put details into `references/*.md`.
- Merge or reorganize references when it improves discoverability.

## Critical prohibitions

- Do not ingest/quote large verbatim chunks of vendor docs; summarize in your own words.
- Do not invent defaults not explicitly grounded in documentation; record uncertainties as TODOs.
- Do not design backup/restore without testing a restore path.
- Do not use NFS as the primary persistence backend (installation docs explicitly warn against it).
- Do not expose internal cluster communication ports publicly; rely on private networking.
- Do not use API keys/JWT over untrusted networks without TLS.
- Do not rely on implicit runtime defaults for production; record effective configuration.
