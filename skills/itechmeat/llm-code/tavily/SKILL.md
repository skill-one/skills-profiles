| Production  | 1,000              |

**Note:** Crawl endpoint limited to 100 RPM for both environments.

Production keys require paid plan or PAYGO enabled.

## Search API

Primary endpoint for LLM-optimized web search.

```python
response = client.search(
    query="Latest AI developments",
    search_depth="advanced",      # "basic" (1 credit) or "advanced" (2 credits)
    max_results=10,               # 1-20 results
    include_answer=True,          # Include AI-generated answer
    include_raw_content=False,    # Include raw HTML
    include_domains=["arxiv.org"],  # Filter to specific domains
    exclude_domains=["pinterest.com"]  # Exclude domains
)
```

### Response Structure

```python
{
    "query": "...",
    "answer": "AI-generated summary...",  # if include_answer=True
    "results": [
        {
            "title": "Page Title",
            "url": "https://...",
            "content": "Extracted relevant content...",
            "score": 0.95,
            "raw_content": "..."  # if include_raw_content=True
        }
    ]
}
```

## Extract API

Extract content from specific URLs.

```python
response = client.extract(
    urls=["https://example.com/article1", "https://example.com/article2"],
    extract_depth="basic"  # "basic" or "advanced"
)
```

## Crawl API

Crawl websites with AI-guided instructions.

```python
response = client.crawl(
    url="https://docs.example.com",
    instructions="Find all pages about Python SDK",  # Optional AI guidance
    max_depth=2,
    limit=50
)
```

## Map API

Get website structure without extracting content.

```python
response = client.map(
    url="https://docs.example.com",
    instructions="Find documentation pages"  # Optional
)
```

## Research API (Beta)

Autonomous deep research on complex topics.

```python
response = client.research(
    input="What are the implications of quantum computing on cryptography?",
    model="pro"  # "pro" (15-250 credits) or "mini" (4-110 credits)
)
```

## Why Tavily?

| Feature          | Traditional Search | Tavily        |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Output           | URLs + snippets    | Full content  |
| Scraping         | Manual             | Built-in      |
| LLM optimization | None               | Purpose-built |
| Filtering        | Manual             | AI-powered    |
| Context limits   | Not handled        | Optimized     |

## Best Practices

1. **Use `search_depth="basic"`** for simple queries (saves credits)
2. **Use `include_answer=True`** for quick summaries
3. **Filter domains** to improve relevance
4. **Use Extract** when you know specific URLs
5. **Use Research** for complex, multi-step queries
6. **Use Python keyless mode only for trials**; it supports `search()` and `extract()` only and remains rate-limited

## Prohibitions

- Do not expose API keys in client-side code
- Do not exceed rate limits (implement backoff)
- Do not scrape sites that block Tavily crawler
