# Pipecat

Pipecat is an open-source Python framework for building real-time voice and multimodal bots.
It composes streaming speech/LLM/TTS services into a low-latency pipeline, connected via transports (WebRTC/WebSocket) and client SDKs using the RTVI message standard.

## Mental model (cheat sheet)

- **Pipeline**: ordered **processors** that consume/emit **frames**.
- **Frames**: the streaming units (audio/text/video/context/events) flowing through the pipeline.
- **Transport**: connectivity + media IO + session state (WebRTC/WebSocket/provider realtime).
- **Runner**: HTTP service that starts sessions and spawns a bot process with transport credentials.
- **Client SDK**: starts the bot, connects transport, sends messages/requests, receives events.

## Recipes

### 1) Keep secrets server-side

- Put provider API keys (LLM/STT/TTS) only on the server/bot container.
- The client should call a server start endpoint (`startBot` / `startBotAndConnect`) to receive **transport credentials** (e.g., a room URL + token), not provider keys.

### 2) Use WebRTC for production voice

- Prefer a WebRTC transport (e.g., Daily) for resilience and media quality.
- Use a WebSocket transport mostly for server↔server, prototypes, or constrained environments.

### 2b) Design for streaming + overlap

- Keep the pipeline fully streaming (avoid batching whole turns when you can).
- If your services support it, start TTS from partial LLM output to reduce perceived latency.

### 3) Initialize and evolve context via RTVI

- Initialize the bot’s pipeline context from the server start request payload.
- For ongoing interaction, prefer a dedicated “send text” style API (when available) instead of deprecated context append methods.

### 4) Function calling: end-to-end flow

- LLM requests a function call.
- Client registers a handler by function name.
- Client returns a function-call result message back to the bot.

### 5) Pipecat Cloud deployment basics

- Build/push an image that matches the expected platform (Pipecat Cloud requires `linux/arm64` in the docs).
- Use a deployment config file for repeatability.
- Configure pool sizing with `min_agents` (warm capacity) and `max_agents` (hard limit).

## Critical gotchas / prohibitions

- Do not embed sensitive API keys in client apps.
- Expect and handle “at capacity” responses (HTTP 429) when the pool is exhausted.
- Plan for cold-start latency if `min_agents = 0`.
- Ensure secrets and image-pull credentials are created in the same region as the deployed agent.
- Do not assume deprecated import shims or service-specific context classes still exist in `1.0.0`; audit imports before upgrading.
- Do not keep VAD/turn-detection logic on transport params; current releases route that control through `LLMUserAggregator` strategies.
- Do not assume `OpenAIResponsesLLMService` is HTTP-based anymore; WebSocket is now the default implementation.
- Do not send a single `button` field in the RTVI `dtmf` client message; as of `1.6.0` it requires `buttons` (a list), and `RTVI.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is `2.1.0`.
- Do not filter OTel dashboards on old GenAI span attribute names (`az.ai.openai`, `xai`, `mistral`, `gen_ai.usage.reasoning_tokens`, bare `tokens.*`); `1.6.0` renamed these to standard `gen_ai.*` conventions.

## Release Highlights (1.9.0 -> 1.11.0)

- **Latency attribution (`1.9.0`)**: `LatencyBreakdown.contributions` is a timeline of the user-to-bot interval whose durations sum to the measured latency — it names the time no service reports (VAD silence, turn detection, turn-completion markers and holds, sentence aggregation, function handlers).
- **Smallest AI continuation (`1.10.0`)**: `SmallestTTSService` shares a `context_id` across text fragments of the same LLM turn so the server joins them into one continuous generation instead of resetting prosody per request; optional `max_buffer_delay_ms` bounds the fragment buffer.
- **Resampler stream boundaries (`1.11.0`)**: `BaseAudioResampler.flush()` returns audio the resampler still holds when a stream has ended and `reset()` starts a fresh stream — callers mark boundaries explicitly instead of relying on `SOXRStreamAudioResampler`'s inactivity timeout.

## Release Highlights (1.7.0 -> 1.8.1)

### Turn detection and tools (1.8.0)

- **Turn detection redesign**: every in-repo service with built-in turn detection now emits `ProposedUserStartedSpeakingFrame` / `ProposedUserStoppedSpeakingFrame`, and `ExternalUserTurnStrategies` resolves them into real turn frames — one subclassable place that decides turns. Third-party services emitting turn frames directly keep working unchanged.
- **MCP made trivial**: `MCPClient.tools()` now auto-connects, registers tools, and closes the connection at pipeline end (just `LLMContext(tools=await mcp.tools())`); `MCPClient(tools_arguments=...)` injects fixed arguments into every call of a tool, hidden from the model's schema. New `KeenableWebSearch` service (`keenable` extra) adds live web search + page reading via a hosted MCP server.
- **MoQ client mode**: dial a shared relay instead of serving your own socket — works behind NAT (`--moq-connect <relay>`, plus `MOQParams.response_path`/`request_path`).

### Workers and error handling (1.8.0)

- **Workers**: `JobParams`/`JobGroupParams` bundle job dispatch metadata, `BaseUIWorker` surfaces jobs on a client UI without an LLM, `WorkerRunner.get_worker(name)` finds peers by name, and `request_cancel_job_group()` allows external cancellation.
- **Error/usable-state model**: `ErrorCategory` (AUTHENTICATION/SERVER/APPLICATION/UNKNOWN), `FrameProcessor.is_usable`, and `on_usable_changed` let handlers tell a briefly-struggling processor from one to retire; `PipelineWorker(processor_unusable_policy=CONTINUE|END|CANCEL)` decides what happens when a processor goes unusable. `AudioVolumeTracker` measures rolling 400ms volume.

### v1.7.0 additions

- **STT usage metrics**: `STTUsageMetricsData` carries `audio_seconds`; enable with `enable_usage_metrics=True` (forwarded to RTVI clients as `stt_usage`, logged by `MetricsLogObserver`, attached to OTel `stt` spans). AWS Nova Sonic LLM adds `LLMUsageMetricsData` token deltas.
- **New/updated TTS/STT settings**: `PocketTTSService` (local CPU-only TTS, 6 languages + voice cloning); `XTTSService` deprecated (removal `2.0.0`, use Kokoro/Piper); `reach_inactive_services` on settings frames; plus per-service settings such as Google LLM `safety_settings`, Azure `force_locale`, Cartesia `keyterm`, Deepgram `numerals`, ElevenLabs `filter_background_audio`, and Smol `endpointing`/`keywords`/`format`.
- **Breaking-behavior changes**: `TavusParams.audio_out_faster_than_realtime` now defaults to `True`; `GeminiLiveLLMService` uses `GeminiLiveLLMAdapter` (hand-crafted `LLMSpecificMessage`s need `llm="gemini-live"`); LiveKit transport adds inbound SIP DTMF (`on_dtmf_event`); `LLMSettings.filter_incomplete_user_turns` deprecated.

### Context Hub (1.8.0)

`pipecat context-hub` (alias `pipecat ch`) lets coding agents query a local index of Pipecat APIs instead of hallucinating them; it ships in the `cli` extra, and `pipecat init` offers to register it with the coding agents it finds and to build the index. `v1.8.1` fixes `pipecat eval run` to read `.yml` scenario files and settles Context Hub staleness-warning behavior.

## Release Highlights (1.6.0)

### New transport and reasoning

- **`MOQTransport`**: a Media over QUIC transport giving bots a bidirectional, low-latency audio + RTVI channel over QUIC instead of WebRTC/WebSocket (`pip install "pipecat-ai[moq]"`). The bot can run as its own MoQ server for local dev; the development runner gained `--moq-serve`, `--moq-bind`, and TLS flags.
- **`reasoning` in OpenAI Responses services**: `OpenAIResponsesLLMService` / `OpenAIResponsesHttpLLMService` accept a `ReasoningConfig(effort=..., summary=...)`; encrypted reasoning round-trips across turns and tool calls automatically, and summaries surface as thought frames / `on_assistant_thought`.

### Flows, evals, and new services

- **Pipecat Flows `NO_RESPONSE`**: a function can return `(result, NO_RESPONSE)` to finish the call without an LLM run or node transition, letting the next user utterance drive the next response.
- **Eval scenarios `absent: true`**: an expectation that passes only if no matching event arrives within `within_ms`, useful for catching duplicate-output regressions.
- **New services**: `CrusoeLLMService` and `BasetenLLMService` (OpenAI-compatible LLM services for Crusoe Cloud and Baseten), `DeepgramFluxTTSService` (websocket TTS for Deepgram Flux, token-streamed by default).
- **Audio token usage**: `LLMTokenUsage` gains `input_audio_tokens` / `output_audio_tokens` / `cache_read_input_audio_tokens`, populated by `OpenAIRealtimeLLMService` (and Azure realtime) and `GeminiLiveLLMService`.

### Breaking changes and deprecations

- RTVI `dtmf` client message uses `buttons` (a list) instead of `button`; `RTVI.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is now `2.1.0`.
- OTel GenAI span attributes were renamed to standard conventions: `gen_ai.provider.name` values for Azure/xAI/Mistral, and `gen_ai.usage.reasoning_tokens` -> `gen_ai.usage.reasoning.output_tokens`; OpenAI Realtime and Gemini Live token attributes are now standardized `gen_ai.usage.*` names instead of ad hoc `tokens.*`.
- ElevenLabs services default to TTS model `eleven_flash_v2_5` instead of the now-deprecated `eleven_turbo_v2_5`.
- `PronunciationDictionaryLocator` is deprecated in favor of `text_transforms` / `replace_text` (removal in `2.0.0`).
- Turn-strategy `reset()` is deprecated in favor of `handle_user_turn_started()` / `handle_user_turn_stopped()` lifecycle callbacks (removal in `2.0.0`).

## Release Highlights (0.0.109 -> 1.2.0)

### Runtime and service additions

- **`OpenAIResponsesLLMService`** now defaults to a persistent WebSocket connection; the prior HTTP behavior moved to `OpenAIResponsesHttpLLMService`.
- **Inworld Realtime LLM** adds a WebSocket cascade STT/LLM/TTS path with semantic VAD and function calling.
- **`MistralTTSService`** adds streaming Voxtral TTS, and TTS/STT services gained more runtime-update and sample-rate options.
- The development runner now exports a module-level FastAPI `app` for custom routes before `main()`.

### Tooling and context changes

- Function calling now supports grouped parallel tool batches, async tool completion after interruption, and streaming intermediate tool results.
- Context editing now has `LLMMessagesTransformFrame`, and the framework standardizes on universal `LLMContext` / `LLMContextAggregatorPair`.
- OpenAI tool schemas can now include provider-specific `custom_tools`.
- `1.2.0` adds `add_tool_change_messages` for LLM aggregators, widens `tool_resources` into deprecated `app_resources`, and extends async-tool compatibility across more realtime providers.

### Turn-taking and client protocol

- `1.2.0` adds explicit inference/finalization turn hooks (`on_user_turn_inference_triggered`, `LLMTurnCompletionUserTurnStopStrategy`, `FilterIncompleteUserTurnStrategies`) for smarter end-of-turn gating.
- RTVI grows first-class UI Agent Protocol support with `ui-event`, `ui-snapshot`, `ui-cancel-task`, `ui-command`, and `ui-task`, bumping the protocol to `1.3.0`.
- The development runner and runner arguments now carry a stable `session_id`, which is useful for per-session tracing across local and cloud-like flows.

### Breaking migrations

- Deprecated service-specific context classes, transport params, RTVI shims, frame aliases, and interruption/VAD helpers were removed across the stack.
- Turn detection and mute behavior moved toward `LLMUserAggregator` strategies instead of transport-level configuration.
- Some legacy providers and helpers were removed entirely (`OpenPipeLLMService`, `TTSService.say()`, `FrameProcessor.wait_for_task()`, older beta/alias modules).

## Release Highlights (1.3.0 -> 1.5.0)

- **Workers and multi-agent pipelines (`1.3.0`)**: `PipelineTask` / `PipelineRunner` are renamed toward `PipelineWorker` / `WorkerRunner`, and `pipecat.workers` makes pipelines peers on a typed-message bus for `@job` dispatch, handoffs, sidecars, UI workers, and distributed Redis/PGMQ patterns.
- **UIWorker and RTVI UI protocol (`1.3.0`)**: `UIWorker` can observe client accessibility snapshots and drive UI commands over RTVI; the UI worker vocabulary moves from `task`/`agent` to `job`/`worker` (`ui-task` -> `ui-job-group`, `cancelUITask` -> `cancelUIJobGroup`).
- **Development runner (`1.3.0`)**: one runner can serve WebRTC, Daily, telephony, and plain WebSocket clients; `/start` accepts a `transport` field, `/ws-client` supports protobuf WebSocket clients, `/status` reports enabled transports, and the Daily redirect moved to `/daily`.
- **Service surface (`1.3.0`)**: adds Vonage Video Connector transport, Inception Mercury 2 LLM service, Cartesia turn-based STT, Rime `coda` TTS defaults, Soniox endpoint-delay settings, `LLMService.append_system_instruction()`, and `STTService.supports_ttfs`. Optional service/transport extras now raise `ImportError` when their dependency is missing, and `transformers` is no longer a base dependency.
- **Behavioral eval framework (`1.4.0`)**: a testing framework for evaluating bot behavior, plus `on_user_turn_message_added` event handlers and realtime LLM-service metadata frames.
- **Pipecat Flows in core (`1.5.0`)**: Pipecat Flows is integrated into the main package, so structured conversation flows no longer require a separate install. **New services (`1.5.0`)**: Together AI STT/TTS services and NVIDIA per-sentence synthesis, with TTFA (time-to-first-audio) metrics for latency tracking.
