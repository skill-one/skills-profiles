## Core rules

- Prefer minimal configuration; extend only as needed.
- Keep `index.html` as a first-class entry point when using Vite defaults.
- Treat dev server settings and build settings separately.
- Document mode-dependent behavior for env variables and `define`.
- Use `future` config to opt-in to deprecation warnings before migration.

## Recipes

- Scaffold a project with `npm create vite@latest`.
- Configure aliases, server options, and build outputs in `vite.config.*`.
- Load `.env` values into config with `loadEnv` when config needs them.
- Add plugins with `plugins: []` and define `apply` or `enforce` when needed.
- Use HMR APIs for fine-grained updates when plugin or framework needs it.
- Use `optimizeDeps.include/exclude` when deps aren't discovered on startup.
- Use `build.rollupOptions.input` for multi-page apps.
- Use the top-level `input` option to declare the entry once for apps without `index.html`; it feeds `build.rolldownOptions.input`, `build.lib.entry`, `build.ssr`, and `optimizeDeps.entries` by default.
- Enable deprecation warnings: `future: { removeSsrLoadModule: 'warn' }`.
- Use `hotUpdate` hook instead of `handleHotUpdate` for environment-aware HMR.
- Use `this.environment` instead of `options.ssr` in plugin hooks.

## Release Highlights (8.0.0)

- Default browser target is raised again under `baseline-widely-available`.
- CommonJS default-import interop becomes more consistent and may expose packages that relied on older ambiguous behavior.
- Vite stops resolving `browser` vs `module` via format sniffing and follows configured `resolve.mainFields` more strictly.
- JS API `build()` now throws `BundleError` with nested `.errors` when multiple Rolldown-level errors are present.
- Rolldown transition becomes more explicit: `build.rollupOptions` / `worker.rollupOptions` are deprecated in favor of `*.rolldownOptions`.

## Release Highlights (8.1.0 -> 8.1.5)

- **WASM ESM integration**: direct `.wasm` imports work as ES modules natively.
- **Zero-config build caching**: integration with Vite Task enables build caching without manual setup.
- **`server.hmr` renamed to `server.ws`**: WebSocket options move under `server.ws`; update configs that set HMR transport options.
- **New options**: `html.additionalAssetSources` for custom asset sources during HTML transform, `import.meta.glob` `caseSensitive`, multiple hosts via `__VITE_ADDITIONAL_SERVER_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and an extended default `server.fs.deny` list.
- **8.1.1 -> 8.1.5**: stability only (stack-trace handling, dependency bumps, module-resolution edge cases).

## Release Highlights (8.2.0)

- **New top-level `input` option**: `input: string | string[] | { [entryAlias: string]: string }` resolves relative to the project root and becomes the default value for `build.rolldownOptions.input`, `build.lib.entry`, `build.ssr` (when set to `true`), and `optimizeDeps.entries` whenever those are left unset; useful for apps that skip `index.html` and would otherwise repeat the same entry path in several options. The resolved `input` paths are also added to `server.fs.allow`, matching how imported modules are already allowed.
- **Bundled dev mode (`experimental.bundledDev`)**: a boundary-less edit now triggers exactly one reload; the client tells the server to rebuild first and only then issues `full-reload`, so the "bundling in progress" fallback page no longer flashes between an edit and the reload. Worker files (`new Worker(new URL(...))`, `?worker` imports) are now correctly re-emitted through HMR instead of going stale after an edit.
- **Native loader / native-config compatibility**: warnings about features unsupported by `configLoader: 'native'` now include a column alongside the line number, and virtual modules are excluded from the native-config compatibility check so plugin-generated virtual files no longer trigger false positives.
- **Type-safe PostCSS config**: Vite exports `PostcssUserConfig` (re-exported from `postcss-load-config`'s `Config` type) so `postcss.config.js`/`.ts` can be typed directly.
- **Network URL labeling**: dev server network URLs now resolve and print the OS network-interface name (e.g. `eth0`, `wlan0`) even when `server.host` is an explicit address, not only when Vite auto-detects every interface.
- **Rolldown and optimizer updates**: Rolldown bumps to `~1.2.0`, bringing client-side HMR handling into `experimental.bundledDev`; the dependency optimizer's lockfile-hash cache now also recognizes `aube-lock.yaml` (Aube) and `nub.lock` (nub), so those package managers correctly invalidate `node_modules/.vite` on dependency changes.

## Patch Notes (8.0.14 -> 8.0.16)

- Rolldown moves to `1.0.3` (was `1.0.2` in `8.0.14`); if you maintain plugin or build guidance, validate it against the current Rolldown behavior instead of assuming early `8.0.x` patch semantics.
- Dev server now sends HTTP `408` on request timeout instead of hanging the connection (`8.0.15`).
- `launch-editor-middleware` rejects UNC paths and Windows alternate paths, closing a local path-traversal vector (`8.0.16`); relevant if you expose the dev server beyond localhost.
- `8.0.15` fixes: `/@fs/` HTML-proxy cache-key mismatch, relative-glob-in-virtual-module errors when no files match, closing the Rolldown bundle when `write()` rejects, and `onWarn` for `viteResolvePlugin` in JS plugin containers.
- `transformIndexHtml` handles trailing-slash paths more reliably, which matters for plugins and static deploy setups that rewrite or inject HTML on directory-style URLs.
- Dependency scanning now passes Oxc JSX options through the optimizer path, so JSX-heavy linked dependencies should behave closer to the main transform pipeline.

## Prohibitions

- Do not copy large verbatim chunks from vendor docs.
- Do not assume framework-specific behavior without verifying.
