# Zvec

Zvec is a lightweight, in-process vector database meant to be embedded into applications ("SQLite for vectors").

## Operator recipes (high signal)

- Minimal “embed Zvec” checklist
  - (Optional) Configure globals once at startup via `zvec.init(...)` (logging, `query_threads`).
  - Create a collection on disk with `create_and_open(path=..., schema=..., option=...)`.
  - Ingest documents as `Doc(id=..., fields=..., vectors=...)` via `insert()` or `upsert()`.
  - Query via `collection.query(vectors=VectorQuery(...), topk=...)`.
  - Call `collection.optimize()` periodically after heavy ingestion.

- Bulk ingest + keep query latency stable
  - Prefer batched `insert()` / `upsert()`.
  - Monitor `collection.stats` and run `optimize()` when flat buffers grow.

- Hybrid retrieval patterns
  - Filter-only: `collection.query(filter=..., topk=...)`.
  - Vector + filter: pass both `vectors=...` and `filter=...`.
  - Multi-vector fusion: pass multiple `VectorQuery` items and rerank using `WeightedReRanker` or RRF.

- Memory-sensitive ANN on x86_64
  - Prefer `HNSW-RaBitQ` when HNSW-quality recall matters but memory is the limiting factor.
  - Start with the documented defaults (`total_bits=7`, `num_clusters=16`) and tune query-time `ef` before changing quantization bits.

- Safe evolution of live collections
  - Add/drop/alter scalar columns via `add_column()`, `drop_column()`, `alter_column()`.
  - Manage indexes via `create_index()` / `drop_index()` (scalar). Vector indexes cannot be dropped.

## Critical prohibitions

- Do not mirror vendor docs verbatim; summarize in your own words.
- Do not assume a client/server deployment model: Zvec is in-process.
- Do not add project-specific paths, secrets, or environment assumptions.
- Do not choose `HNSW-RaBitQ` on unsupported hardware; current docs limit it to `x86_64` with `AVX2` or better.

## Release Highlights (0.7.0)

- **C++ API is now snake_case (breaking).** `Index`, `Collection` and methods like `Open()`, `Search()`, `Query()`, `Insert()` moved to `index`, `collection`, `open()`, `search()`, `query()`, `insert()`. C and Python API names are unchanged. See `references/data-operations.md` for migration notes.
- **Wider DiskANN platform support.** DiskANN indexes now run on Linux ARM64 and macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon), auto-selecting the best I/O backend.
- **New index and quantization options.** IVF RaBitQ, uniform uint7/uint8 quantizers, a Turbo PQ-INT8 quantizer (L2/Cosine/IP), Turbo record quantizers with portable scalar distance kernels, and an optional Fast Hadamard Transform (FHT) preprocessor before quantization.
- **RaBitQ runtime SIMD dispatch.** HNSW-RaBitQ selects AVX2 or AVX512 at runtime from the host CPU, so no instruction set needs to be hard-coded at build time.
- **Better HNSW graph quality.** Optional Vamana two-pass graph build, and building the graph from the original (unquantized) vectors while search still runs against the stored lossy vectors.
- **FTS ngram tokenizer.** A character-level tokenizer for short text, code, or pinyin, configured via the index `extra_params`.
- **`DocIterator`.** Stream the full collection as a snapshot without loading it into memory; exposed across the C++, C, and Python bindings.
- **Concurrent `optimize()`.** Reads and writes now proceed while optimization runs, so long optimizations no longer stall ingest or retrieval.

## Release Highlights (0.6.0)

- **Pluggable Turbo quantizer**: the Turbo module now exposes a Quantizer abstraction with a uniform interface, decoupling quantization logic from index builders/searchers so future quantizers (int8 uniform, int8 record, PQ, RaBitQ, and more) can plug in without touching index code. Ships with a first `Fp32Quantizer` implementation and scalar FP32 distance kernels.
- **Random rotation for INT8/INT4 quantization**: an optional random orthogonal rotation (`enable_rotate`) spreads variance evenly across dimensions before quantizing, cutting quantization error. On the cohere-1m benchmark this took HNSW INT8 recall from 0.9285 to 0.9397, Flat INT8 from 0.9695 to 0.9881, and HNSW INT4 recall from 0.2114 to 0.7117 — a large jump that makes INT4 viable in more scenarios.
- **Group-by search**: query results can now be deduplicated/grouped so you get the top-K per group instead of top-K globally, across Flat, HNSW, HNSW-RaBitQ, and sparse indexes (with `fetch_vector`, `is_linear`, and `bf_pks` query modes), exposed through the Python API.
- **Zero-copy Python vector queries**: the Python query path now points `VectorViewClause` directly at the source numpy buffer instead of memcpy-ing through `serialize_vector`, removing redundant copies for dense vector queries.
- **Richer FTS tokenization**: the standard tokenizer now implements Unicode 17 UAX #29 word-boundary rules (Lucene-style handling for alphanumeric, ideographic, hiragana/katakana/hangul, Southeast Asian scripts, and emoji), backed by utf8proc 2.11.3 for Unicode-aware lowercasing and a new ASCII-folding filter. A Snowball-based stemmer token filter (34+ languages, set via `stemmer_lang`) reduces words to their root form.
- **Complete DiskANN C API**: the C API now covers DiskANN end to end — index param getters/setters, query param CRUD, and query wiring for vector queries, group-by queries, and sub-queries — matching the existing HNSW/FTS C API patterns.
- **Faster FTS conjunction/phrase queries**: block-max skip plus score early-exit in the conjunction iterator skip non-competitive 128-doc blocks outright; benchmarked on a 500k-doc dataset this made AND queries 22-38% faster and phrase queries 33% faster.
- **Stability fixes**: assorted fixes to FTS correctness (segment stats on reopen, zero-match filter semantics, compaction doc-id gaps), index race conditions in DiskANN/HNSW/IVF, SQL engine group-by parameter handling, and collection LOCK-file behavior for read-only collections.

## Release Highlights (0.5.1)

- **External vector source**: ingest and query from external vector sources for more flexible data pipelines without first copying everything into the collection.
- **Zero-copy query path**: `VectorViewClause` establishes a zero-copy vector query path with unified query validation, lowering per-query memory overhead.
- **Search prefetch tuning**: pass prefetch settings (`PO`, `PL`) directly through search parameters for finer performance control.
- **Index/storage controls**: `is_dirty` is exposed on the core `Index` interface, and copy-on-write MMAP options (with a corrected `MMAP_POPULATE` placement) are configurable.
- **C API FTS sub-queries**: full-text search now works inside sub-queries via the C API.

## Release Highlights (0.5.0)

- **Full-text search (FTS)**: attach an FTS index to any string field via `create_index()` / `drop_index()` and query it with natural-language or structured expressions, alongside vector indexes.
- **Hybrid retrieval**: the `MultiQuery` API combines dense vectors, sparse vectors, scalar filters, and text in one query with consistent reranking across Python, Go, Rust, and C++.
- **DiskANN index**: keeps the bulk of the index on disk instead of RAM, cutting memory use for billion-scale datasets on memory-constrained hosts.
- **Output field selection**: `fetch()` accepts an `output_fields` parameter to control which fields are returned.
- **New SDKs and tooling**: official Go SDK (cgo, prebuilt Linux/macOS/Windows libs), Rust SDK (RAII, builder APIs), and Zvec Studio (`pip install zvec-studio`) for visual data browsing and query testing.

## Release Highlights (0.3.0 -> 0.4.0)

- **Windows** support and official Windows packages for Python and Node.js
- **HNSW-RaBitQ** quantized vector indexing for lower-memory ANN on supported x86_64 hosts
- **Stable C API** for building or maintaining additional language bindings
- **MCP server / agent skills** ecosystem for AI-driven collection management and retrieval workflows
- **0.3.1 hotfixes** for relaxed collection path restrictions and better Windows cross-drive/path handling
- **0.4.0** adds official Dart/Flutter bindings, iOS build support, a larger `topK` ceiling, stricter `query_params` validation, and fixes an SQ8 quantizer recall regression.
