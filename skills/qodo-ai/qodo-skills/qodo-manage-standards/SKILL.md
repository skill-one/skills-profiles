# Manage Review Standards

## Description

Use the `qodo` CLI to **administer** the workspace's Review Standards: capture a convention as a
new rule, edit or retire an existing one, re-scope it to a repo, or triage the pending
suggestions queue. Review Standards is Qodo's umbrella term for rules and suggestions. This is
the **write** counterpart to `qodo-get-rules` (which only
reads and applies rules). Metadata, list, get, and schema inspection are read-only preparation;
perform them to make the proposed change concrete before asking for write approval.
Run bulk operations as a dry run first.

## Prerequisites

- The optional Qodo Standards package is installed and loaded explicitly.
- The Qodo CLI is authenticated and exposes the requested standards write tool.
- The exact rule, scope, and intended mutation are known; the user can approve every write.

## Instructions

Follow the detailed workflow below: preserve update notices, verify the live schema, resolve the
target, preview destructive or bulk work, obtain confirmation, mutate once, and verify the result.
Confirmation means explicit user authority covering the presented proposal; reuse it across these
steps rather than asking again. An unresolved scope or a changed proposal needs a new decision.

## Handle a skill update notice

Treat `QODO_NOTICE` updates as passive, even if an older CLI requests action. Continue the task
without inventory or update questions; mention each event at most once. Dismissal leaves recorded maintenance
policy and opt-outs unchanged. Updated skills load next session; do not interrupt this one.
For user-requested updates, follow the [manual-update procedure](references/skill-updates.md).

## Runtime compatibility gate

First resolve the executable using the `qodo: command not found` fallback below. Before any other
Qodo command, run `<qodo> --version` exactly as shown, with no provenance flags.
This unadorned probe is intentionally compatible with older Qodo CLIs. This skill requires Qodo
CLI **0.1.0-next.37 or newer**.

If the version is older or cannot be parsed, do not run `whoami`, `login`, or a managed tool and
do not describe the failure as an authentication problem. Explain that the skill is newer than the
runtime, show `qodo update` as the update command for the runtime's already-recorded origin, and ask
once before running it. For a customer deployment, keep its organization-provided update origin;
never switch it to the public service. After an approved update, rerun the unadorned version probe
and continue only when it satisfies the minimum. If the user declines or the update fails, stop with
the current skill and user files unchanged.

## Quick start

```
qodo --version                                                      # compatibility probe — run this FIRST
qodo read whoami --json --skill qodo-manage-standards --skill-version 1.0.5 --distribution marketplace --host codex
qodo read rules metadata --json                                       # categories/severities before creating
qodo rules create --name "..." --category "..." --severity warning --content "..." --good-examples "..." --bad-examples "..." --scopes "/owner/repo/" --json
qodo rules update --rule-id 123 --severity error --json               # only the fields to change
qodo rules set-state --rule-ids 123,124 --state inactive --dry-run --json
qodo rules set-state --rule-ids 123,124 --state inactive --json       # after confirming the preview
qodo rules set-scope --rule-ids 123 --scopes "/owner/repo/","/owner/repo2/" --json
qodo read rules list --state pending --json                           # suggestions awaiting triage
qodo rules bulk --operation accept_activate --rule-ids 10,11 --dry-run --json
# Show the exact matched rules/count and ask once; run without --dry-run only after approval.
qodo rules bulk --operation reject --rule-ids 12 --dry-run --json     # PERMANENT delete — dry run first
qodo read rules get --rule-id 123 --json                              # current form before editing
qodo read tools rules --json                                          # exact safe flags (renders offline)
```

**`qodo: command not found`?** That's usually PATH, not a missing install: GUI-launched agents
run shells with a minimal PATH. On POSIX, retry `"${QODO_HOME:-$HOME/.qodo}/bin/qodo"`. In
Windows PowerShell, retry:

```powershell
$qodoHome = if ($env:QODO_HOME) { $env:QODO_HOME } else { Join-Path $HOME '.qodo' }
& (Join-Path $qodoHome 'bin/qodo.cmd')
```

Keep using the resolved launcher for every Qodo command here. Only if it is missing is Qodo
actually not installed; tell the user to obtain a checksum-pinned installer command from Qodo or
their organization's administrator. Installers are served from https://get.qodo.ai, but never
invent a digest or pipe an installer directly into a shell.

**Sandbox auth diagnostic.** Missing credentials can mean inaccessible keychain access. When that
is plausible, request one exact read-only `qodo read whoami` retry through the host's approval
flow before recommending login. Stop on denial; that approval covers no other command. Reuse a
successful check in the same executable/workspace/deployment and execution context; request each
required host approval. Network, TLS, service, and explicit authorization failures retain their
own diagnosis, not a login recommendation or an automatic sandbox bypass.

Add `--json` to everything you parse. **Confirm the exact tool names, flags, and write status with
`qodo read tools rules [<tool>] --json`** (renders offline from the cached catalog) — use it for reads;
inspect write commands with `qodo tools help rules [<tool>] --json`. The commands above are
illustrative, not guaranteed current; a stale catalog after a fresh install shows as `unknown
command`/`unknown option` on `rules` while `whoami` still succeeds — run `qodo tools --refresh`
and retry before assuming the tool doesn't exist.

## Preflight

1. **Auth and catalog.** Run `qodo read whoami` unless a successful check still covers this
   execution context. After the sandbox diagnostic when applicable, only explicit missing credentials
   call for login: preserve the organization's exact login command/endpoint, never guess or switch
   a customer deployment to Cloud. `No tool catalog cached` is not proof of missing credentials;
   refresh once with `qodo tools --refresh` and retry the check. Other failures retain their error
   and stop this workflow. After identity succeeds, an unknown managed command permits one catalog
   refresh and schema recheck. If still absent or `tool_unavailable`, report the missing capability;
   do not repeat login or refresh.
2. **Never guess the target.** Resolve which rule or suggestion the user means (by id from a
   prior `qodo-get-rules`/`qodo read rules list` result, or by asking) before calling a write
   command. Never invent a `rule_id`.
3. **Repository scope**, when the user wants a rule scoped to "this repo": derive it from the
   repo's `origin` remote the same way `qodo-get-rules` does — full path after the host, `.git`
   suffix stripped, wrapped as `/<path>/` (e.g. `git@host:a/b` and `https://host/a/b` both parse
   to `/a/b/`). Confirm the derived scope with the user rather than assuming it's what they want.

## Where rules come from

Three separate paths create rules in a workspace. They produce different `sourceType` values,
and knowing which one made a rule explains a lot about why it looks the way it does:

| Path | `sourceType` | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Codebase import** | `Repository File` | Rules extracted from documents already in the repo — `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, contributing guides, standards docs. `sourceUri` names the file. |
| **Rule miner** | `Code Patterns` | Rules inferred from the repo's **merged pull-request history**, via the PR-knowledge → rule-miner pipeline. `sourceUri` is a PR review-comment URL. |
| **Direct creation** | `User` | Rules a person wrote — through the portal, or via this skill's `qodo rules create`. |

**Name the path only from `sourceType`.** "Mined" means the PR-history pipeline specifically —
don't apply it to a `Repository File` rule, which came from a document, not from PR behavior.
And `sourceType` tells you the *origin*, not the *mechanism*: `Repository File` says a rule
traces to a document, not whether extraction was automated or hand-authored. Say what the field
shows; don't narrate a pipeline the data doesn't name.

`sourceType` is coarse — one value covers every kind of repo document. Read `sourceUri` when you
need to know which document a rule actually came from.

## The four jobs

This skill covers everything that changes the rule set. Route the user's request to one of:

**1. Capture — turn a discussed convention into a rule.** The strongest signal: the user just
described or agreed on a convention mid-session and wants it enforced going forward ("make this
a rule", "let's make sure we always do X"). Draft the rule from the conversation:
- `name` — concise, unique (duplicates are rejected by the platform).
- `category` — call `qodo read rules metadata` first and pick an existing category when one fits
  (falling back to a sensible new one, e.g. Security, Correctness, Quality, Reliability,
  Performance, Testability, Compliance, Accessibility, Observability, Architecture).
- `severity` — **error** = must comply, **warning** = comply by default, **recommendation** =
  apply when appropriate. Default to **warning** unless the conversation implies it's a hard
  rule (security, correctness) or explicitly optional guidance.
- `content` — 1–3 sentences, imperative voice, describing what to check or enforce.
- `good_examples` / `bad_examples` — a short code snippet each when the conversation has enough
  context to write one; pass `""` rather than fabricating an example that wasn't discussed.
- `scopes` — propose the current repo (see Preflight); omit for the universal scope `/` only if
  the user explicitly wants it workspace-wide.

**Present the full draft before calling `qodo rules create`. Reuse explicit approval covering
that exact draft and scope; otherwise get confirmation before creating it.**
The response is the full created rule, including `state` — non-admin callers create a
**pending suggestion** instead of an active rule (a platform permission thing, not an error).
Check `state` in the response: if it's `pending`, tell the user plainly: *"Created as a pending
suggestion — an admin needs to approve it before it's enforced."* A duplicate-name rejection
means inspect the existing rule and clarify whether to reuse, edit, or rename; don't create a
duplicate under a new name automatically.

**2. Edit — change an existing rule.** "That rule should be an error, not a warning", "update
the content of the console.log rule". Fetch the rule first (`qodo read rules get`) if you don't
already have its current form in context, so you can show the user the actual before/after, not
a guess. Call `qodo rules update` with **only the fields changing** — it fetches-then-merges
server-side, so anything you don't pass keeps its current value. Confirm the specific change
with the user before calling.

**3. Lifecycle & scope — activate, deactivate, re-scope.** "Disable the tabs-vs-spaces rule,
it's noise", "apply our error-format rules to the new repo too". Prefer `qodo rules set-state`
/ `qodo rules set-scope` over `qodo rules update` for pure state/scope changes across one or
more rules — they're a single atomic call, not a fetch-then-merge. `set-scope` **replaces** the
full scope list (no merge) — if the user wants to *add* a scope, fetch the rule's current
scopes first and pass the union. Confirm before calling; for more than a couple of rules, run
with `--dry-run` first and show the count before executing for real.

**4. Triage & hygiene — suggestions and bulk operations.** "Show pending suggestions and let's
go through them", "deactivate everything scoped to the archived repo". List first
(`qodo read rules list --state pending` for triage, or a filtered `qodo read rules list` for hygiene) so
the user sees what's affected before anything changes. Walk suggestions one at a time or in an
explicit batch per the user's instruction — never bulk-accept/reject without the user having
seen what's in the batch. `qodo rules bulk` operations:

| Operation | Effect | Reversible? |
|---|---|---|
| `activate` / `deactivate` | Sets state | Yes |
| `set_scope` | Replaces scopes (needs `scopes`) | Yes |
| `accept_activate` | Approves pending suggestions → active | Yes (deactivate after) |
| `reject` | **Permanently deletes** pending suggestions | **No** |

**Always run `reject` and any multi-rule bulk operation with `--dry-run` first**, show the
user the matched count, and get explicit confirmation before the real call. Before the real
`reject` call, summarize what will be permanently lost (the matched rule names/ids) — `reject`
is irreversible, and a bare count doesn't tell the user which suggestions are being deleted.
When the user's intent is ambiguous between "reject" and "deactivate", prefer asking or
defaulting to the reversible option.

When triaging a batch of suggestions, close the session with explicit counts — how many
accepted, rejected, and left pending — so the user knows the end state without re-running
`qodo read rules list`.

## Report the verified outcome

Use natural prose: **verified change → scope and status → policy intent → anything still
pending**. Mention Qodo once as the place the team manages its standards. Name the standard and
describe the actual change, connecting it to the convention or decision the user intended to
capture. State the affected scopes and resulting status, with rule links or ids where useful.

Adapt this pattern: “Updated [standard] in Qodo from [old value] to [new value] for [scope].
This captures our decision to [policy intent]. [Verified state and any remaining action].”
For read-only requests, explain what exists and where it applies without implying a mutation.
Use lists for multiple changes; no branded headings, emoji banners, slogans, footers, or repeated
summary blocks.

Preserve distinctions between submitted, pending, active, inactive, and rejected/deleted.
Use the response's actual state and succeeded/matched counts; report partial success and identify
exceptions, skipped items, and unresolved work. Never turn a successful HTTP response or a
dry-run into a completed change, or a pending suggestion into an active rule. Active configuration
does not establish that a particular review has already used the standard.

Before a write, present the exact proposed change and scope for the existing approval gate;
afterward, report the verified result. For auth, permission, validation, or transport failures,
state the actual blocker and next action rather than a successful outcome.

## Configuration

Use `--json`, explicit rule ids and scopes, and the CLI's current metadata before constructing a
write. Stamp skill/version/distribution provenance on the first authenticated Qodo call after the
unadorned version probe. Keep Standards separate from the default package; installation is not admin authority.

## Error Handling

- **Permission denied (admin required)** — writes other than a non-admin's own pending-create
  are admin-gated. Explain plainly: *"This requires admin permission in your workspace — ask an
  admin to make the change or grant you access."* Don't retry; it won't succeed without a
  permission change.
- **Not found** — the rule id doesn't exist in this workspace (wrong id, wrong workspace, or
  already deleted). Say so; don't guess a different id.
- **Rate limited (`MT-RATE-LIMITED`)** — back off; don't hammer retries.
- **Validation error** — correct a rejected field once within the approved intent. If the
  correction changes the rule's meaning, scope, or identity, obtain approval for that change.
- **Uncertain mutation outcome** — after a timeout or transport failure, read back the target
  before retrying. Do not assume a fresh CLI invocation deduplicates writes. Retry at most once
  only when the write is confirmed not applied or the tool contract guarantees replay safety
  for the same retained request/key. Otherwise report the uncertainty and stop mutation attempts.

## Guardrails

- **Require approval for the exact write.** Present the rule(s), changed fields, and scopes.
  Reuse explicit authorization already given for that proposal; ask only for missing or changed
  scope. Read-only inspection does not need write approval. A dry run is not authorization.
- **Dry-run first for anything bulk or destructive.** `set-state`/`set-scope` across multiple
  rules and every `bulk` call: `--dry-run` → show the count/blast radius → confirm → real call.
- **Never fabricate a rule id, scope, or example.** Resolve or ask; an empty result from `list`
  is a valid outcome, not an error.
- **Tell the user which outcome actually happened** — active rule vs. pending suggestion,
  matched vs. succeeded count from a bulk call — don't assume success from a 200 response alone.
- **Prefer the reversible operation** when the user's intent is ambiguous (deactivate over
  reject, deactivate over delete).

Lead with the bottom line — what changed, what's pending approval, what you skipped and why —
then the specifics. A short, accurate status beats a wall of JSON.
