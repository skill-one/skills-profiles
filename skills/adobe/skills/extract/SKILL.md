description: Crawl an existing website (capped, multi-page) and seed stardust/current/ with PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, DESIGN.json, a per-page inventory, and the consolidated brand surface — the captured design system, palette, typography, motifs, and voice of the live site. Use when the user wants to analyze an existing site's design, extract or reverse-engineer its design system or brand, capture design tokens from a live site, import a website as the starting point for a redesign, capture the current state before a migration, or invokes `$stardust extract` (`/stardust:extract` in Claude Code). Trigger phrases include "analyze this site", "extract the design tokens", "capture the brand", "crawl the site", "reverse engineer the design". Not for scraping page data or content for its own sake (it captures design evidence, not datasets), and not for the redesign itself — extraction is descriptive; direction and prototyping happen downstream.

# stardust:extract

Crawl an existing website, parse each page, extract the brand surface,
and produce a stardust-formatted snapshot of the current state under
`stardust/current/`. The output describes what the site **is**; later
sub-commands consume it to decide what it **should be**.

This skill is **descriptive**: it does not invent direction, it does not
critique, and it does not modify the live site. It writes only under
`stardust/current/` and updates `stardust/state.json`.

## Inputs

- `<url>` — required. The origin to crawl. Examples: `https://example.com`,
  `https://example.com/shop`. A path narrows the same-origin crawl to
  that subtree.
- `--cap <N>` — optional. Override the default 5-page cap. The cap
  is intentionally small — a 5-page sample (home + four IA
  pillars/templates) is enough for cross-page brand aggregation,
  system-component detection, and the brand-review HTML; lift it
  (e.g. `--cap 25`) when a deeper crawl is genuinely needed.
- `--all` — optional. Lift the cap entirely; extract every
  discovered page after junk filtering. Equivalent to `--cap 0`.
  Use when the user spontaneously asks for a full crawl.
- `--pages <slug,slug,...>` — optional. Restrict the crawl to specific
  paths (slugs derived per `reference/ia-extraction.md`). Bypasses
  the cap.
- `--refresh <slug>` — optional. Re-extract one page that already exists
  in `state.json`.
- `--single` — optional. Equivalent to `--cap 1`. Useful for testing.
- `--wait <fast|medium|spec|auto>` — optional. Wait strategy per page.
  Default `medium`. See `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Wait modes.
- `--no-junk-filter` — optional. Disable the default junk-page filter
  in discovery (see `reference/ia-extraction.md` § Filtering).
- `--no-consent-dismiss` — optional. Skip the pre-flight consent /
  cookie banner dismissal (see `reference/playwright-recipe.md`
  § Pre-flight: consent dismissal). Use when the redesign scope
  includes the consent surface or the dismissal's side-effects
  (script activation that wouldn't otherwise run) must be
  avoided. Default is to dismiss, keeping screenshots, voice
  aggregation, and per-section style unpolluted by the banner.
- `--dynamics` — optional, **migration-bound**. Record per-page reach
  signals of the dynamic surface (data endpoints, forms, modal
  triggers, player ids) in each page JSON `dynamic` section and roll
  them up in `_crawl-log.json#dynamicSurface`. Set by
  `prepare-migration`, `replica` and `migrate`'s safety net; never by a
  bare extract, `uplift` or `audit` — dynamics is a migration concern.
  Depth and classification belong to the stardust `dynamics` skill.
- `--concurrency <n>` — optional. Parallel browser contexts for the
  per-page capture loop. Default 4; sane range 4–8. See
  § Concurrency.
- `--brand-source <url>` — optional, repeatable. An additional
  **same-brand** origin whose brand surface enriches the primary
  extraction (shallow capture: home + up to 2 nav-linked pages).
  See § Cross-site brand sources.
- `--design-source <url>` — optional. Design-donor origin: its
  design system is captured to `stardust/canon-source/` and becomes
  the fixed redesign target while the primary origin supplies
  content. See § Cross-site brand sources.
- `--prep` — optional. Run in **migrate-prep mode**: lift the cap,
  type each page, detect module candidates, capture typed content
  slots, emit the prep summary. See § Prep mode below. Typically
  invoked via the `prepare-migration` orchestrator skill rather
  than directly.

## Setup

Run the master skill's setup procedure first
(`skills/stardust/SKILL.md` § Setup): impeccable dep check, context
loader, state read.

Additional checks for this sub-command:

1. **Playwright availability.** The extraction step needs a real
   browser. Detect Playwright in this order: a Playwright MCP server,
   then a project-importable `playwright` module. **The `npx
   playwright` probe is NOT sufficient** — it confirms the CLI
   (which resolves a global install) but the recipe and
   `scripts/crawl.mjs` do `import { chromium } from 'playwright'`,
   and ESM module resolution does **not** honour a global install or
   `NODE_PATH` — the import throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` even where
   `npx playwright --version` succeeds. Verify the module is
   import-resolvable from the project root (probe:
   `node -e "import('playwright').then(()=>process.exit(0))"`); if it
   isn't, run `npm i -D playwright pixelmatch pngjs cheerio --legacy-peer-deps`
   (devDependencies, never `--no-save` — #125) or use the Playwright MCP
   server, before crawling. The
   `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is required on `aem-boilerplate` targets
   (their pinned `eslint@8` makes a plain `npm i` exit `ERESOLVE`
   before playwright is even considered). Don't trust the CLI
   probe alone.

   **`--no-save` installs are ephemeral.** Any later real `npm i` (e.g. a setup step
   adding a devDependency) prunes non-manifest packages, silently
   removing playwright mid-pipeline. Every downstream skill that
   renders (prototype, migrate, deploy, diff) must re-run the
   import-resolvability probe — and re-install on failure — at the
   start of its own run, not assume extract's install survived.

   **Script location matters.** ESM resolves `import 'playwright'`
   from the *script's* directory and the plugin tree ships no
   `node_modules`: copy every script byte-identical into the project
   (`stardust/scripts/…`) and run the copy.

   **Bundled crawler.** `skills/extract/scripts/crawl.mjs` is a
   runnable reference implementation of this whole sub-command —
   browser config + bot-management fallback, consent dismissal, wait
   + scroll, the capture list, per-page full-page screenshots
   (`assets/screenshots/<slug>.png`, consumed by the Phase 2.5
   vision gate), response validation, and the §
   Capture-hygiene hardening (visibility filter, interstitial drop,
   SPA-shell flag, modal `textContent` capture, tracking-pixel
   discounting, cross-page duplicate detection). Prefer invoking it over
   hand-rolling a Playwright script per run; extend its in-page
   `capture()` to cover any recipe field it doesn't yet emit.
2. **Origin collision.** If `stardust/state.json` already records
   `site.originUrl` and the new `<url>` is a different origin, stop and
   ask before clobbering. Stardust does not silently mix two sites in
   one project.
   **Flow guard (migration asks only).** If the ask carries migration
   intent ("migrate", "to EDS", "re-platform", "1:1", "replica") and
   `stardust/state.json` exists — or is about to be created — without
   `flow`, hand back to the master skill § Two migration flows before
   crawling: the flow is chosen and stamped there, and a keep-design
   ask enters through `replica` (which invokes this skill with `--prep`
   itself). A bare `extract <url>` for a redesign, audit or uplift is
   unaffected. (Recorded: `extract` on a raw URL as the entry of a
   same-design migration; the agent then built its own importer beside
   `replica`.)
3. **Browser contexts.** Open a fresh `BrowserContext` per capture
   worker (§ Concurrency; default 4). Run the **consent dismissal
   pre-flight** per `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Pre-flight:
   consent dismissal *unless* `--no-consent-dismiss` is set.
   Cookies persist within a context but **not across contexts** —
   re-establish consent state per context (re-run the dismissal on
   the worker's first page, or clone the probe context's
   `storageState`). Record the resolved method in
   `_crawl-log.json#consent.method`.
4. **Bot-management probe.** When the first navigation in the run
   returns `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` or `ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR`,
   or hangs through the entire hard-cap on what should be a fast
   origin, **do not retry headless** — switch to headed Chrome per
   § Failure modes → Bot-management block and record the switch in
   `_crawl-log.json#discovery.fetchTechnique` so re-runs start in
   headed mode without rediscovering the issue.

## Procedure

### Phase 1 — Discovery

Discover the page inventory before crawling. Procedure in
`reference/ia-extraction.md`. In summary:

1. Fetch `<origin>/sitemap.xml`, then `<origin>/sitemap_index.xml`,
   then check `robots.txt` for `Sitemap:` directives.
2. If no sitemap is reachable, run a same-origin BFS crawl from
   `<url>`, depth-limited to 3, link-extracting from rendered HTML.
3. Filter the discovered URL list: same origin only, exclude
   `mailto:`, `tel:`, anchor-only links, query-only variations,
   common asset paths (`.css`, `.js`, `.pdf`, image extensions).
4. De-duplicate trailing-slash variations.
5. Apply the junk-page filter (`reference/ia-extraction.md` §
   Junk-page filter) unless `--no-junk-filter` is set. Surface the
   filtered list to the user as overridable.
6. Apply the cap (default 5, or `--cap`, or `--all` for no cap)
   and **proceed silently**. Print an informational summary of
   what was kept and what was cut — but do **not** gate on user
   confirmation. Users who want different scope set it
   spontaneously at command time:

   ```
   $stardust extract https://example.com              # default 5 pages
   $stardust extract https://example.com --cap 25     # bump to 25
   $stardust extract https://example.com --all        # lift the cap
   $stardust extract https://example.com --pages home,about,pricing
   $stardust extract https://example.com --single     # just the entry URL
   ```

   The agent reads spontaneous scope intent from the user's prompt
   (e.g. "extract all pages", "look at just the home and pricing",
   "do a full crawl") and applies the equivalent flag. No
   re-confirmation needed once intent is clear.

   Informational output (not a prompt — proceed immediately):

   ```
   Discovered 38 pages on https://example.com (sitemap.xml).
   Filtered as likely junk (5): /test/, /sample-page/, /holiday1/, ...
   Selecting 5 highest-priority pages:
     - / (home)
     - /about
     - /pricing
     - /products
     - /contact

   Cut (28 pages, --all to lift): /blog/post-1, /blog/post-2, ...

   Extracting...
   ```

   Selection heuristic: page-type checklist first, then score-based
   ranking (home + IA-pillar keywords + sitemap priority − archive /
   version markers). See `reference/ia-extraction.md` § Page
   selection and § Priority for the cap. The English-only keyword
   list is a known limitation for localized sites.

7. Write the discovered list to `stardust/current/_crawl-log.json`
   (created if absent) with `_provenance` and the full discovery
   reasoning, including `filteredAsJunk[]` and `userChoice`. This is
   an audit trail, not a state file.

### Phase 2 — Per-page extraction

For each page in the cap-respecting list, render with Playwright
following `reference/playwright-recipe.md`. Captures run
**concurrently** per § Concurrency. The recipe is
mandatory per page — in particular, do not skip the wait, scroll, or
capture-list steps:

- Viewport 1440 × 900 @ 2× DPR
- Wait per the configured wait mode (default `medium`; see § Wait
  modes in `reference/playwright-recipe.md`)
- Disable animations via `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- After the wait resolves, scroll to bottom in 4 viewport-height
  steps with 300 ms pauses, then return to top — this is required
  to trigger lazy-load and IntersectionObserver-driven content
- Record `waitMs` and `waitMode` in the per-page `_provenance`

Capture per page (full schema in `reference/current-state-schema.md`):

- Page metadata (title, meta description, OG tags, theme-color)
- Semantic structure: heading outline, landmark roles, sections
- **Hero headline + lede (resolved)** — `heroHeadline` / `heroLede`
  picked by font-size × hero-region with a junk/hidden-state filter and
  a clean meta-description fallback (per `reference/playwright-recipe.md`
  § Capture list 5-bis). Required for JS-rendered sites whose
  document-order headings surface modal / promo / count junk
  instead of the real tagline.
- Content: visible text per section (full innerText, **no
  truncation** per `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Capture
  list 7), structured paragraphs (`body[]`), lists, FAQ Q/A
  pairs, and review/testimonial quotes per
  § Capture list 7-bis. Without these structured fields,
  every body region under a heading falls back to placeholder
  signature at migrate time.
- CTA labels and href targets, link inventory (internal vs external)
- Per-section computed style summary: dominant colors, font families
  in use, spacing rhythm, border-radius, shadows
- Media inventory: img with `currentSrc`/`srcset` captured **with
  query strings intact** plus a `resolves` flag (HEAD/GET with browser
  UA + Referer), intrinsic dimensions, inline SVG count, video/iframe
  presence, `cssBackgrounds[]` (including pseudo-element `::before`/
  `::after` walks per § Capture list 11) so `background-image`
  heroes and motifs do not silently disappear and 404ing CDN
  images are flagged before migrate ships `about:error`.
- Font files captured via network-intercept (per § Capture list
  16): every `woff2`/`woff`/`ttf`/`otf` response saved under
  `assets/fonts/` and recorded in `_brand-extraction.json#type.files[]`
  with licensing flag.
- Icon-font detection (per § Capture list 17): when the page
  uses `[class^="icon-"]` with non-default `::before`
  font-family + codepoint, capture the family, save the file,
  and record the `iconClass → codepoint` table in
  `_brand-extraction.json#iconFont`.
- Interactive elements: forms (with field types), buttons, modals
  detected by ARIA roles
- Full-page screenshot to `assets/screenshots/<slug>.png` —
  script-captured by the bundled crawler after the wait/scroll
  settle (viewport-only fallback on extremely tall pages; mode in
  `_signals.screenshotMode`, relative path in the page JSON
  `screenshot` field)

- **Dynamic surface (only with `--dynamics`)** — per-page reach
  signals: endpoints, third-party script hosts, forms, modal triggers,
  player ids, hydration hints, in the page JSON `dynamic` section and
  `_crawl-log.json#dynamicSurface` (schema in
  `reference/current-state-schema.md § Dynamic`). Evidence only; the
  stardust `dynamics` sub-skill probes archetypes in depth and decides.

Save to `stardust/current/pages/<slug>.json` with `_provenance` as the
first key. **The bundled crawler also saves the settled rendered DOM
verbatim as `stardust/current/pages/<slug>.html`** (`page.content()`
after the wait/scroll settle; path in the record's `renderedHtml`
field). Capture once, parse offline: every downstream importer or
sibling generator iterates its extraction against this artifact —
free, reproducible, and provenance — instead of re-running live
probes per selector guess (recorded: 4+ live round-trips per page
family before the switch). Live probes stay for what the static DOM
cannot answer: geometry and computed styles. Save referenced media to `stardust/current/assets/media/`
preserving basename plus a short content hash.

**Live-render evidence (synthesis is forbidden).** Refuse to mark
a page `extracted` in `state.json` unless its `_provenance`
contains `renderedBy: "playwright"`, an ISO-8601 `fetchedAt`, a
positive integer `waitMs`, a `waitMode` from the recipe, and a
final `httpStatus` in the 2xx/3xx range. These five fields are
the contract enforced by `reference/current-state-schema.md`
§ Live-render evidence and read back by every downstream phase
via `validateProvenance()` per
`skills/stardust/reference/state-machine.md` § Provenance
validation. Synthesizing a page record from
`_brand-extraction.json` plus URL patterns plus captured photos
— the 2026-04-30 e-commerce shortcut — is the failure mode this
guard exists to prevent. When the agent (or a delegated sub-
agent) cannot satisfy the contract for a page, treat the page
as a Phase 2 failure: record under `_crawl-log.json#crawl.failures[]`
with `errorClass: "ProvenanceMissing"` and continue.

Mark the page `extracted` in `state.json` immediately after each
successful page write. If a page fails, record the error in
`_crawl-log.json` and continue — extraction is best-effort per page.

### Phase 2.5 — Vision verification

Before anything downstream is authored, **look** at each captured
page's screenshot (`assets/screenshots/<slug>.png`) — the multimodal
model reads the image — and verify it against the extracted record:

- Does the recorded hero (headline + asset) match what the pixels show?
- Is the extracted palette plausible against the pixels?
- Does a `cssBackgrounds: []` record look believable, or is imagery
  visibly present — a silent capture failure?
- Is the logo captured?
- Is the page actually rendered — not a consent wall, bot-block
  page, or blank SPA shell?

Read the whole page through its thumbnail —
`node stardust/scripts/thumb.mjs stardust/current/assets/screenshots/<slug>.png --width 480`
(`skills/extract/scripts/thumb.mjs`, copied beside `crawl.mjs`; a
box-filter downscale, so 1-px rules and hairline borders survive; its
`--max-bytes` cap, 150 KB by default, re-encodes a heavy page narrower
first and crops only as a last resort, never below 60 % of the page) —
never the full-resolution screenshot, and read any detail as a crop of
the full capture. The check is of the WHOLE page: read the script's
stdout line before the image, and when it prints a share below 100
(`cropped at <n>px of <H> = <share>%`) run the same command with
`--offset <n>` and read `<slug>-thumb-<n>.png` too, repeating while its
`rows <n>-<end>px` line ends short of `<H>`. A recorded hands-off run's
thumbnails kept a median 28 % of each page and the check read them as
the page. **A thumbnail enters the context only after `thumb.mjs` has
written it (≤ 150 KB, or the floor thumbnail it named on stderr, exit 1)
— or the vision check runs in a subagent that reads the thumbnails and
returns one line per page**
(`<slug>: ok | recaptured | suspect — <note>`); a recorded hands-off run
read eight `*-thumb.png` files of 268–608 KB each into one context —
3.2 MB of pixels for eight verdicts.

On mismatch, re-run that page's capture with the escalation ladder
before proceeding: bump the wait mode one step
(`reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Wait modes), then headed Chrome
(§ Bot-management fallback), then a fresh browser context. Record
the outcome per page in `_crawl-log.json#visionCheck[]`:

```json
{ "slug": "pricing", "verdict": "recaptured", "notes": "record said zero CSS backgrounds; screenshot shows a full-bleed photo hero" }
```

`verdict` is `"ok" | "recaptured" | "suspect"` — `suspect` means the
mismatch survived the ladder; downstream phases treat that record as
unreliable. Vision is the **authoritative** capture check; the
heuristic defenses (low-media flag, `spaShellSuspect`, duplicate
hash) remain as cheap early signals but no longer gate alone.

### Phase 3 — Brand-surface extraction

Run after the capture phases (2–2.5). Aggregation **may proceed
incrementally** as concurrent page captures complete (§ Concurrency),
but the written file must reflect every extracted page — including
brand-source pages per § Cross-site brand sources.
Produces `stardust/current/_brand-extraction.json`
per `reference/brand-surface.md`. Some fields are home-only (logo,
voice samples, register heuristic); the visual tokens that drive
DESIGN.md (palette, radius, shadow, type) are aggregated across **all
extracted pages** to avoid the home-page bias documented in
`brand-surface.md` § Aggregation scope.

**Computed-style census — run the shipped instrument; author no
probe.** `node <plugin>/skills/extract/scripts/style-census.mjs`
(copied into the project like `crawl.mjs`, § Setup) measures every
captured page at 1440 and writes
`stardust/current/_computed-styles.json`; add `--width 360` when the
breakpoints include it. One more live pass over every page — run it
ONCE, after the crawl, in the background; it opens the live side
through `live-session.mjs` like every other live instrument. Read the
palette, type, motif and hover values from the file's `aggregate` and
cite each from its `sources[]` (`url`, `selector`, `prop`); the
per-page detail sits under `pages[url][width]`.

**Content-cap model — run the shipped probe; author no lift (#124).**
`node stardust/scripts/replica/cap-probe.mjs <archetype-url>… --write-design
stardust/current/DESIGN.json` (replica's script; copy it with `live-session.mjs`)
renders each archetype at 1440 and at a DERIVED wide width —
max(2560, largest cap × 1.25); a probe AT a cap's width cannot see it — and
records every box that stops growing (kind `shell` / `content` / `module`,
px, authored via, tier) into `extensions.breakpoints`: `containerMaxWidth`
(the `--max-width` source; null when fluid), `probeWidth`, `caps[]`,
`modules[]`. One navigation per archetype after the census (never beside
it), once DESIGN.json is authored (it merges). A cap on the shell or
on every archetype is design intent whatever its value; `capRegister` lists
single-module or archetype-divergent caps for the inconsistency register.
Source breakpoints are never inherited — the target keeps its own two.
Captures:

- **Logo** by the v1 priority chain: inline SVG → `<img>` with
  logo-ish class/id → `apple-touch-icon` → `og:image` → favicon →
  synthesized placeholder. Save to `stardust/current/assets/logo.<ext>`.
- **Favicon** — ALWAYS captured as its own asset (independent of the
  logo chain) to `stardust/current/assets/favicon.<ext>`, per
  `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Favicon capture. Downstream,
  `prototype` embeds it in the proposed page head and `deploy` ships
  it to the Edge Delivery site.
- **Palette** — aggregate computed colors across **all extracted
  pages** (background, text, accents, borders, hovers). Frequency-sort,
  cluster near-duplicates, emit a role-named list (background, surface,
  text, primary, secondary, accent).
- **Type** — font families in use with their weights, sizes, and
  computed line-heights. Identify the heading family vs body family.
  Run the modular-scale audit (`brand-surface.md` § Modular-scale
  audit) and emit `scaleAudit.kind = "modular" | "ad-hoc"`.
- **Motifs** — signature border-radius (cross-page mode of non-zero
  values, weighted by element count), shadow stack (top 3 distinct,
  cross-page), gradient inventory, common patterns (chip, badge,
  card, hero-with-image). When the home-only mode disagrees with the
  cross-page mode, surface the divergence in `_provenance.notes`.
- **Voice samples** — first paragraph of body copy, the hero headline,
  3 representative CTA labels, a representative link list. Used by
  `direct` later but extracted now so the network round-trip is over.
- **Hero image** — elevate the home page's primary visual
  asset to `voice.heroImage` (per `reference/brand-surface.md`
  § heroImage resolution), so downstream prototype picks the
  live hero rather than the `og:image` from the raw media list.
- **Hero medium (signature)** — when the hero/first viewport carries a
  *moving* asset (background `<video>` / HLS / canvas / WebGL /
  Lottie / animated SVG / scroll-driven motion), elevate it to
  `voice.heroMedium` (per `reference/brand-surface.md` § heroMedium
  resolution). This is the page's **signature**; without elevation
  downstream prototype flattens it to a static hero. A non-null
  `heroMedium` triggers signature
  preservation (`skills/stardust/reference/intent-dimensions.md`
  § 8b) at prototype time.
- **Icon font** — when detected per `reference/playwright-recipe.md`
  § Capture list 17, populate `_brand-extraction.json#iconFont`
  with family, file path, and the `iconClass → codepoint`
  table so prototypes can render the brand's actual icons.
- **System components** — cross-page repeated DOM blocks (site
  header, site footer, cross-promo strips, persistent CTAs,
  breadcrumbs). Detected by heading-sequence + CTA-label fingerprint
  per `reference/brand-surface.md` § System components. Required —
  these are usually the most load-bearing surfaces and must not
  silently disappear from the redesign target.
- **Origins** — one entry per contributing origin in
  `_brand-extraction.json#origins[]` per `reference/brand-surface.md`
  § Origins. Single-origin runs emit a one-entry array; brand-source
  runs attribute widened evidence per origin.

Do not invent values. Every captured value cites a source selector or
URL in `_brand-extraction.json` for traceability.

### Phase 4 — Seed `stardust/current/PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md`

The current-state PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md are **descriptive, not
authored** — there is no interview to run because the user is not
defining intent here, the agent is describing the existing site. Write
them directly using impeccable's format specs (impeccable's skill
directory is what `node <plugin>/skills/stardust/scripts/impeccable-version-check.mjs --where`
prints; read each spec by section, not whole):

- For PRODUCT.md, follow the section structure in impeccable's
  `reference/init.md` § Write PRODUCT.md. File order: stardust's
  `<!-- stardust:provenance … -->` block first (per
  `../stardust/reference/artifact-map.md` § Provenance, as for every
  file this skill writes), then `# Product`, then the
  `<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->` comment verbatim, then
  `Platform` (`web`), `Users`, `Product Purpose`, `Positioning`,
  `Capabilities and Constraints`, `Brand Commitments`, `Evidence on
  Hand`, `Product Principles`, `Accessibility & Inclusion`; omit a
  section rather than pad it. Under `Brand Commitments` record the
  register guess from the brand surface (sites that read as
  marketing/landing → `brand`; tools/dashboards → `product`; ambiguous
  → `brand` with a note), the observed brand personality and the
  observed anti-references. `Evidence on Hand` lists what was captured
  under `stardust/current/` with paths. Populate `Users`, `Product
  Purpose`, `Positioning` and `Product Principles` from the captured
  copy and the brand surface. Where the agent must infer, mark the
  section with `_provenance: inferred` and a one-line basis sentence.
- For DESIGN.md and DESIGN.json, follow the format spec in
  impeccable's `reference/document.md`. Populate frontmatter
  (`colors`, `typography`, `rounded`, `spacing`, `components`) from
  the captured tokens. The `extensions` block of DESIGN.json carries
  v1's `componentStyle`, `motifs`, and `voice` arrays so nothing is
  lost, and `breakpoints` — the cap-probe sizing model — verbatim.

Stardust does **not** invoke `$impeccable init` (formerly `teach`) or
`$impeccable document` for the current-state files: those commands write to project
root (the *target*) and run an interview. Stardust authors the
descriptive snapshot directly. The format spec from impeccable is the
contract; the runtime command is not.

The target-state PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md at the project root are
written by `$stardust direct` in Phase 2 of the pipeline, not here.

### Phase 5 — Render `stardust/current/brand-review.html`

After Phase 4 writes the descriptive PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md, emit
the current-state brand review per
`reference/brand-review-template.md`.

The brand-review HTML is the **first surface a human can eyeball** to
verify the extraction before committing to a redesign direction —
misreads that are invisible in JSON (a wrong dominant radius, a
missing system component, a single-page palette bias) are obvious to
the eye while they are still cheap to fix (re-extract is fast;
re-direct + re-prototype is not).

The template is mandatory. In particular:

1. Run the **Tensions detectors** listed in
   `reference/brand-review-template.md` § Detectors. Each rule is
   mechanical; emit a tension card whenever the trigger condition
   matches. The review may ship with zero tensions if the data is
   too thin to evaluate, but the detectors must always be run.
2. Render in the brand's **own captured colors and fonts**, not a
   stardust shell.
3. Embed all CSS; do not load external JavaScript or fonts unless
   the live site already does.
4. Cite the source artifact for every section (e.g.
   `_brand-extraction.json § type` under Typography).

If the data for a section is missing, **omit the section** — do not
fabricate placeholders. The coverage callout at the top reflects what
is missing.

### Phase 6 — Update state and report

After all Phase 2-5 writes succeed:

1. Update `stardust/state.json` (schema in
   `skills/stardust/reference/state-machine.md`):
   - `site.originUrl`, `site.extractedAt`, `site.pageCap`,
     `site.totalDiscovered`, `site.crawled`
   - `pages[]` — one entry per crawled page with `status: "extracted"`,
     filled `currentStatePath`, empty `prototypePath` and `migratedPath`
   - `designSource` — only when `--design-source` was used:
     `{ url, capturedAt, path }` per § Cross-site brand sources
2. Print a one-screen summary:
   ```
   Extracted https://example.com (5/38 pages, sitemap.xml)

   stardust/current/
     PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, DESIGN.json, brand-review.html,
     pages/ (5), assets/logo.svg, _brand-extraction.json, _crawl-log.json

   Per-page evidence:
     slug         live  waitMode               waitMs   status  media(img/bg)
     /            yes   medium                 2380     200     38/6
     /pricing     yes   medium                 1940     200     9/0   ⚠ low-media
     /contact     yes   domcontentloaded(fb)   8000     200     3/0
     ...

   Wait summary: 4 resolved at medium (avg 2.4s), 1 fallback (timed out at 8s)
     → /contact may be under-captured; consider --refresh
   Media summary: 1 page flagged low-media (/pricing) — see media-coverage check
   Vision check: 4 ok, 1 recaptured (/pricing) — _crawl-log.json#visionCheck

   Open stardust/current/brand-review.html to verify the extraction
   before running $stardust direct.

   Coverage note: extracted 5 of 38 discovered pages; 5 pages
   covering distinct templates is usually sufficient for the
   cross-page brand surface. Widen with --cap <N> or --pages.

   Next: $stardust direct  (resolve a redesign direction)
   ```

   The **per-page evidence table** is mandatory. The `live` column
   is `yes` when `_provenance.renderedBy === "playwright"` AND
   `waitMs > 0`, else `no`. A `no` row means the page record was
   not produced by a live Playwright render — the visible column
   is the defense-in-depth signal for the failure mode the
   write-time guard exists to prevent (2026-04-30 e-commerce run). A
   maintainer scanning the summary should see `yes` on every row.

   Compute the wait summary by grouping each page's `_provenance.waitMode`
   and averaging `waitMs`. List slugs whose `waitMode` ends in
   `(fallback)` (rendered as `(fb)` in the table for width) as
   candidates for `--refresh`.

   The **`media(img/bg)` column** is the analogous defense-in-depth
   signal for imagery. It prints `<count of media.imgs> / <count of
   media.cssBackgrounds>`. Flag a row `⚠ low-media` when the page
   reads as brand/marketing (register `brand`, or a landing/solution/
   product template) yet has `cssBackgrounds: []` **and** few large
   rasters (no `media.imgs` entry with intrinsic width ≥ 600). That
   combination is the signature of a silently-failed background /
   lazy-media walk — a capture pass that specs the full background
   walk (`playwright-recipe.md` § Capture list 11) yet silently
   produces nothing still ships an image-less capture (2026-06-26
   a SaaS site: `cssBackgrounds: []` on every page, all product
   imagery lost). A flagged row is the cue to re-run that page with
   `--refresh` (and, if it persists, to fall back to headed Chrome per
   § Bot-management fallback). A maintainer scanning the summary should
   treat a `brand`-register site with all-zero `bg` counts as suspect,
   not as "this site uses no background images."

## Cross-site brand sources

Two flags widen extraction beyond the primary origin — **read
`reference/cross-site-sources.md` in full whenever either flag is
present**. Both are opt-in; without them this section is inert.

Core contract (merge rules and capture shapes in the reference):

- `--brand-source <url>` (repeatable) — a **same-brand** sibling
  gets a shallow capture (home + ≤2 nav-linked pages, full recipe +
  provenance) under `stardust/current/brand-sources/<host>/`.
  Evidence, not inventory: never enters `state.json.pages[]`.
  Its palette/type/motif/voice evidence aggregates into
  `_brand-extraction.json` with per-origin attribution
  (`origins[]`); conflicts resolve toward the primary; widened
  traits are attributed, never invented. Excluded from system
  components, `voiceTable`, and cross-promo detection.
- `--design-source <url>` — a design donor is captured to
  `stardust/canon-source/` (same shapes as `current/`, default cap),
  its descriptive DESIGN.md/json derived per Phase 4 rules, and
  `state.json.designSource = { url, capturedAt, path:
  "stardust/canon-source/" }` stamped. `direct` pins the donor
  system as the target (its § Mode A); donor evidence never
  aggregates into the primary `_brand-extraction.json`.

## Sibling-site discovery

After the primary crawl (Phases 2–2.5), harvest candidate same-brand
origins from evidence **already captured** — no extra navigation:

- footer / nav links out to other properties
- "our brands" / "our companies" pages
- `hreflang` alternates on other domains
- subdomain families (`shop.`, `careers.`, country subdomains)
- `og:site_name` matches across captured pages

List candidates with confidence + the evidence line in the crawl
report and in `_crawl-log.json#siblingCandidates[]`:

```json
{ "origin": "https://example.co.uk", "confidence": "high", "evidence": "hreflang alternate on 4/5 pages", "decision": "included" }
```

- **Interactive:** propose — *"found 3 candidate sibling properties —
  include as `--brand-source`?"* — and proceed on the answer.
- **Hands-off** (`state.json.handsOff` is true): auto-include up to
  **2 high-confidence** candidates as brand-sources; record the
  decision in `siblingCandidates[].decision`.

Discovery is capped and cheap: harvesting reads captured evidence
only, and each included sibling gets the shallow brand-source
capture (≤ 3 pages). It must never balloon the crawl.

## Concurrency

Page captures run **concurrently**: the Phase 2 queue is drained by
4–8 parallel browser contexts (`--concurrency`, default 4). Each
worker owns its `BrowserContext`; consent state is re-established per
context (Setup step 3). Media `resolves` / HEAD checks are batched
with `Promise.all`. Brand-surface aggregation (Phase 3) may proceed
incrementally as pages complete, so long as the written
`_brand-extraction.json` reflects every extracted page. The bundled
crawler implements the pool (`crawl.mjs --concurrency <n>`).

Across processes, per `state-machine.md`: stardust does not lock. Two
concurrent extracts on the same project are last-write-wins. Document
this in the user report; do not engineer around it.

## Failure modes

- **Network failure mid-crawl.** Continue, record in `_crawl-log.json`,
  end with a partial state. State.json reflects only successfully
  extracted pages. User can re-run; already-extracted pages are
  skipped unless `--refresh <slug>`.
- **HTTP 4xx/5xx, non-HTML content, soft-404s.** Validated explicitly
  per `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Response validation. Each
  produces a distinct error class (`HTTPError`, `ContentTypeError`,
  `EmptyPageError`) recorded in `_crawl-log.json#crawl.failures[]`.
  Failed pages do **not** appear in `state.json` as `extracted` —
  they appear only in the failure log. Without this validation a 5xx
  page silently lands as an empty success and propagates wrong data
  to `direct` and `prototype`.
- **Login wall.** Do not attempt to authenticate. If the home page
  redirects to a login screen, capture that one page, mark the rest as
  unreachable, and ask the user how to proceed (provide cookies via
  Playwright config, change the entry URL, or scope to public pages).
- **Bot-management block (Akamai / Cloudflare / F5 / Imperva).**
  When the first navigation returns `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`,
  `ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR`, or hangs through the hard-cap on a
  TLS/H2 fingerprint check, the issue is JA3/H2 fingerprinting on
  bundled-chromium-default headless mode — not auth, not network.
  Switch to `headless: false, channel: 'chrome'` per
  `reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Bot-management fallback. Do
  **not** retry headless: it will fail identically. The headed
  fallback works against most enterprise / commerce origins;
  `playwright-extra` + stealth plugin is a non-standard escape
  hatch for the residual cases. The headed window pops visibly,
  which is acceptable for interactive runs and unacceptable for
  unattended pipelines — surface this to the user when first
  triggered. Note for asset harvest: a page-level bot wall usually
  does NOT gate assets — media/CSS/font URLs commonly return 200 to
  a plain browser-UA curl even while every page navigation is
  challenged (Cloudflare challenge, field-confirmed). Probe one
  asset with curl BEFORE reaching for in-page-fetch machinery; the
  in-page harvest is the fallback, not the default.
- **JavaScript-only content.** Playwright already handles this. If
  the configured wait condition never fires within the mode's hard
  cap (`reference/playwright-recipe.md` § Wait modes), fall back to
  `domcontentloaded` and capture what is rendered. Record the
  fallback in the per-page `_provenance.waitMode` and surface in the
  wait-summary line of the final report.
- **Synthesis attempt (forbidden).** When the agent (or a delegated
  sub-agent) cannot run a real Playwright render for a page —
  whether due to time pressure, token budget, or a tool/network
  failure — the only correct outcome is to record the page as a
  Phase 2 failure (`errorClass: "ProvenanceMissing"` in
  `_crawl-log.json#crawl.failures[]`) and continue. **Synthesizing
  a page record from `_brand-extraction.json` plus URL patterns
  plus captured photos at "semantically matching" template
  positions is forbidden.** The shortcut produces output
  indistinguishable from a successful run and propagates
  fabricated content through every downstream phase
  (2026-04-30 e-commerce run: 20 of 25 pages synthesized, caught
  four phases later).

## Prep mode (--prep)

When invoked with `--prep`, extract runs an extended pass that
prepares the inventory for migration — **read
`reference/prep-mode.md` in full before running any `--prep`
extraction**. Discovery-mode runs (without `--prep`) are unchanged:
small cap, no typing, no module detection. The flag is intended for
the `prepare-migration` orchestrator, though direct invocation is
supported.

Core contract (procedure, formats, and detection rules in the
reference):

- `--prep` implies `--all` — migration coverage requires the full
  junk-filtered inventory, not the discovery cap.
- Page types (`landing | article | listing | program | form |
  static | unique`) are LLM-inferred into `state.json.pages[].type`
  (discovery-mode runs leave `type` null); the user confirms in
  `direct --prep`.
- Module candidates (cross-page structural repeats, detected by the
  signal-source priority in the reference) are drafted under
  `DESIGN.json.extensions.modules[]` with `status: "candidate"`;
  per-page JSON gains a typed `slots` section per page-type.
- **Locale-root capture gaps are settled before Phase 2 of any flow.**
  After the crawl, `crawl.mjs` takes every captured locale root (a one-
  or two-segment path of locale codes — `/en`, `/fr-ca`, `/ca/en`),
  lists the same-origin targets linked from that page under its own
  path, and marks the ones missing from the capture:
  `_crawl-log.json#captureGaps` (`roots[]` with `root`, `slug`,
  `linked`, `uncaptured[]`, plus `detail`, a ready ledger string) and
  one `[crawl] capture gaps:` stderr line. Copy `roots[]` to
  `state.json.site.captureGaps` (the `site` block is extract's; an
  uncaptured target never becomes a `pages[]` row) and carry `detail`
  verbatim in the ledger `end` line that closes the extraction —
  `ledger.mjs extract prep end --detail "… uncaptured first-level
  targets: ca/en 15, fr/fr 0"` (replica's `extract end` repeats it) — so
  the owner decides on the gap now (widen with `--pages`, or record it
  as scope debt), not in the rollout link audit: two recorded hands-off
  runs captured `/ca/en` as a locale root while 15 `/ca/en/*` pages
  existed on the source, and found out six hours later, when 15 links
  answered 404 and the gap exceeded the 12-page deliver threshold.
- The prep summary replaces the Phase 6 report; its
  `Provenance: <live>/<total> live` line is mandatory, and any
  ratio short of `<total>/<total>` means the run failed the
  synthesis guard and is incomplete.
- When delegating extraction to a sub-agent, the sub-agent prompt
  **must** forbid synthesis by name and require the per-page
  evidence table and wait-summary line in its return
  (`reference/prep-mode.md` § Sub-agent prompt requirements);
  missing any of the three is a recipe violation.
