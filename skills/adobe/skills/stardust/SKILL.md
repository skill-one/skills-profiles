description: Guided multi-page redesign of an existing website through a four-phase pipeline — extract (crawl and capture the current site), direct (set a visual direction), prototype (generate redesigned HTML), and migrate (emit a deployable static site). Tracks progress incrementally per page in stardust/state.json so redesigns are resumable. Delegates the per-page design craft (typography, spacing, color, layout, motion) to the impeccable skill. Use when the user wants to redesign, revamp, modernize, or restyle an existing site they can point to by URL, run the extract/direct/prototype/migrate flow, or resume a multi-page redesign or migration. Also routes the same-design migration flow (replica) and the donor-design flow (reskin). Not for designing a brand-new site from scratch or one-off single-component edits.

# stardust

You are operating the `stardust` skill: a guided redesign of an existing
website. The user's job is to say what they want; your job is to reason about
what that means, propose a plan, and execute it through a small set of
sub-commands that delegate the actual design work to **impeccable**.

## Setup (run before anything else)

1. **Verify impeccable is installed.** Stardust has a hard dependency on
   impeccable and ships no fallbacks. Look for the `impeccable` skill wherever
   the harness installs skills or plugins: the skill list the harness exposes
   to you, project skill directories (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`,
   `.cursor/skills/`, `.github/skills/`), or the harness's plugin cache
   (Claude Code: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`; GitHub Copilot:
   `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/*/impeccable/skills/impeccable`). If it is
   not installed, stop and tell the user:
   > Stardust requires impeccable. Install it from
   > <https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable> and re-run the command.

   **Version hint (advisory, never blocking).** Stardust deliberately pins
   NO impeccable version — the design craft should always be the current
   one — and harnesses do not announce third-party plugin updates by
   default (Claude Code's marketplace auto-update is off for third-party
   marketplaces such as impeccable's; Copilot has no update notice). So,
   once per session, run
   `node <plugin>/skills/stardust/scripts/impeccable-version-check.mjs`
   (add `--local <impeccable-dir>` when impeccable lives in a harness skills
   directory rather than the plugin registry) and surface its one output
   line to the user verbatim when it reports a newer version; it prints the
   update command for the harness it found impeccable in. Any other outcome (current, unknown, offline) is
   noise — do not mention it, and never stop or degrade a run over it.
   The same script with `--where` prints impeccable's skill directory
   (the one holding its `SKILL.md` and `reference/`); note it once — the
   phases that read impeccable's format specs (`reference/init.md`,
   `reference/document.md`) read them from there by section, never after
   a filesystem search.
2. **Check the target-state files.** `PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md` at the
   project root are the *target* state for stardust; check whether they
   exist (a directory listing is enough). Do not run impeccable's context
   loader (`scripts/impeccable context`) here: it emits directives for
   impeccable's own flow (init, new-work, detector, update checks) that do
   not apply to stardust's setup, and impeccable runs it itself whenever
   stardust invokes an impeccable command. Skip if already known from this
   session's history.
3. **Read stardust's state.** Read `stardust/state.json` if present
   (`reference/state-machine.md` defines the schema). Note which pages are
   `extracted`, `directed`, `prototyped`, `approved`, or `migrated`.
4. **Read impeccable's command registry.** Parse
   `<harness>/skills/impeccable/scripts/command-metadata.json`. This is the
   single source of truth for the 24 impeccable commands; never hardcode
   them in your reasoning.
5. **Status ledger.** Every stardust skill appends a phase-transition line
   to `stardust/status.jsonl` at each phase start/end, per
   `reference/run-status.md` — written with `skills/stardust/scripts/ledger.mjs
   <skill> <phase> <start|end|blocked> [--detail …]` (it knows each skill's
   phase names and warns on an unknown one; `--strict` refuses it), never
   with a hand-built `printf`. Page status moves with
   `skills/stardust/scripts/state.mjs advance <slug…> --to <status>`; a
   resuming agent orients with `ledger.mjs tail` and `state.mjs summary`.
6. **Project hygiene** (idempotent). Write `stardust/.gitignore` from
   `reference/stardust.gitignore` if absent; never edit a project's copy.
   In a git repo: root `.gitignore` covers `.env` / `.env.*` (managed
   `# >>> stardust` block), `.hlxignore` if present lists `stardust/`, and
   `git check-ignore -q stardust/state.json` must fail — if it passes,
   stop and name the rule. Offer, never write, LFS above 50 MB of tracked
   binaries under `stardust/`. Details in `reference/artifact-map.md`
   § Versioning.

## Routing

Once setup is done, route on the user's input:

- **No argument.** Render the **state report** described in
  `reference/state-machine.md`: project state, per-page status table,
  recommended next command, with reasoning. Do not write anything.
  The same applies to any **resume**: a new session on a project that
  has `stardust/state.json`, "continue", "where are we", or a resume
  driven by a memory file. Start with the state report (it names the
  flow and the last gate numbers), then enter the next phase **through
  its skill** — the procedure drives, not memory. (Recorded: a
  144-hour resume session invoked no stardust skill at all, re-read
  the procedure through `grep`, and followed whatever the previous
  context remembered.)
- **First word names a sub-skill.** Delegate to the matching sub-skill
  and pass remaining args through. Sub-skills are named by their bare
  skill name below; how to address one depends on the harness. Claude
  Code namespaces plugin skills as `stardust:<name>` (Skill tool);
  GitHub Copilot and other harnesses that flatten plugin skills expose
  the bare `<name>`. If the harness has no skill-invocation tool, read
  the sub-skill's `SKILL.md` and follow it inline. Never confuse the
  stardust `extract` and `audit` skills with impeccable's `extract` and
  `audit` commands, which are always written `$impeccable <command>`.
  The master skill routes **all** sibling sub-skills:

  | keyword | owns |
  |---|---|
  | `extract` | crawl + capture the current site |
  | `direct` | resolve the visual direction |
  | `prototype` | per-page redesign prototypes |
  | `migrate` | full-site platform-agnostic static HTML |
  | `prepare-migration` | the migrate-prep cascade (prep phases, assets, dynamics gate) — **redesign flow only** |
  | `replica` | same-design migration (re-platform, keep the current design) — runs its own preserve-mode prep, then hands off to migrate/deploy/rollout |
  | `reskin` | byte-faithful content re-laid onto a separately defined donor design system |
  | `deploy` | one page → EDS blocks + DA delivery |
  | `rollout` | whole migrated site → EDS, with coverage + delivery gates |
  | `dynamics` | the dynamic surface of a migration — detect, classify, triage, implement, verify (APIs, search, forms, modals, media, tags, client-rendered, sheet data); migration-bound, invoked by prepare-migration / replica / migrate / rollout or standalone on an already-migrated site |
  | `diff` | prototype ↔ build fidelity probes (pixel + structural) |
  | `audit` | three-perspective site audit — design tensions, SEO/technical, LLM visibility — scored report + findings ledger |
  | `qa` | read-only post-deploy QA sweep of the live site — routing, fidelity, template conformance, rendering, visual regression, SEO, links, a11y, perf — findings report only, never fixes |
  | `uplift` | one-shot presales orchestrator (3 variants) |

  - `prototype` accepts `--cinematic` (or `--cinematic=<register>`)
    to layer a brand-faithful motion register on top of the static
    prototype (per `skills/prototype/reference/motion-registers.md`).
  - `uplift` is the one-shot presales orchestrator: takes a URL and
    produces three differentiated variants (one fully cinematic)
    without further user coordination. Use when the user wants to
    skip the extract/direct/prototype chain (per
    `skills/uplift/SKILL.md`).
- **Migration to EDS — pick ONE of two flows, never mix them.** See
  § Two migration flows below before answering any "how do I migrate X"
  question; the routing answer differs by whether the design is kept.
- **First word is anything else (a freeform phrase).** Treat it as a
  redesign intent. Load `reference/intent-reasoning.md` and follow the
  procedure step by step. **Do not execute any impeccable or stardust
  command before showing the resolved plan to the user** (under
  hands-off mode, the plan is recorded in `stardust/direction.md`
  instead of awaiting confirmation — see § Hands-off mode).

## Two migration flows — pick one, never mix

When the user wants to migrate a site to AEM Edge Delivery (or any clean
front end), the FIRST question is whether the design is kept or changed.
That answer selects the flow; the downstream chain is shared.

- **Redesign while migrating:** `extract` → `direct` → `prototype`, or in
  one orchestrated step `prepare-migration` (the prep cascade with
  confirmation gates) → `migrate` → `deploy` (one-page pilot) /
  `rollout` (whole site).
- **Keep the current design (re-platform):** `replica` → `migrate` →
  `deploy` / `rollout`. `replica` **subsumes the prep cascade in preserve
  mode** — `extract --prep` is its Phase 1, a mechanical
  direction-preservation step replaces `direct --prep`, and gated
  archetype recreation (measured source-fidelity gate per breakpoint)
  replaces `prototype --prep`. **Never run `prepare-migration` before or
  after `replica`**; there is no separate prep step in this flow.
- **New design from a donor, same content:** `reskin` — content is
  byte-gated, design comes from another live site or local prototypes.
- **Both migration flows carry the dynamic surface by default.** The
  pre-import gate (`prepare-migration` 4.5 / `replica` Phase 2, with
  `migrate` as the safety net) runs the stardust `dynamics` skill Phases 1–3 so
  every API, search box, form, modal, player, tag and client-rendered
  surface gets a disposition before import; `rollout` D2 implements the
  reproducible rows and `qa` replays parity. Never for redesign-only
  work (`uplift`, a bare `extract`): dynamics is a migration concern.

**Choosing, and recording the choice.** Read the ask before any sub-skill
loads:

- **Keep-design phrases select `replica` without a question:** "exact
  replica", "1:1", "pixel-perfect", "faithful", "same design", "keep the
  current design", "as is", "re-platform only", "migrate keeping the
  design", or a direction phrase that pins every axis unchanged
  (`ia-fidelity: verbatim` with palette, type and density all pinned).
- **Redesign phrases select the redesign flow:** "redesign", "modernise",
  "refresh", "new look", "rethink", "reimagine" — any phrase that moves a
  design axis.
- **Anything else** ("migrate X to EDS", "build a migration plan for X")
  asks the one keep-vs-redesign question — the only question this section
  asks. Under hands-off it is not asked: a keep-design phrase selects
  `replica`, otherwise `redesign`, recorded as a named assumption in
  `direction.md`.

Stamp the choice in `state.json` as `flow` / `flowChosenAt` / `flowSource`
(`reference/state-machine.md` § Flow keys) before delegating. The
sub-skills enforce it: `migrate`, `deploy`, `rollout` and a
migration-intent `extract` refuse to start a migration on a project with
`state.json` and no `flow`; `prepare-migration` refuses under
`flow: replica` and `replica` under `flow: redesign`. Switching is
explicit — `$stardust replica --switch-flow` / `$stardust
prepare-migration --switch-flow` — and marks the old flow's prototyped or
migrated pages stale (§ Per-page state).

**Planning aids belong to one flow.** Redesign: the `prepare-migration`
plan and its phase gates, the canon, module catalogs, template plans of
the "learn the template, then compile" kind. Keep-design: `replica`'s
inconsistency register and `progress.json`, the archetype gate ledgers,
`rollout` waves. A redesign procedure or plan template inside a replica
run — or the reverse — is a routing defect: refuse it, or flag it in
`direction.md` and hand back to this section. (Recorded: a same-design
migration adopted a redesign-only "train the template, then compile" plan
and spent an hour, 45 turns and 36 M tokens before reverting it; another
loaded `prepare-migration` for a keep-design ask on a plugin that already
described the two flows — description without a guard did not hold.)

State the chosen flow explicitly in the first response to a migration
question, including the fact that `replica` needs no `prepare-migration`
step, so the user never has to ask which prep applies.

## Hands-off mode

Activated by `--hands-off` on **any** stardust invocation, or by an
explicit user phrase ("fully hands-off", "no approval gates", "run
autonomously"). On activation, stamp `state.json.handsOff: true`
(schema note in `reference/state-machine.md` § Hands-off keys) and
append an activation line to `stardust/direction.md`. The mode removes
**waiting**, not **validation**: every quality gate in the pipeline
still runs at full strength; what changes is who resolves the
interactive pauses.

Under hands-off, every interactive gate across the pipeline
auto-resolves:

| gate | hands-off resolution |
|---|---|
| `direct` clarifying questions | derive the answers from the captured evidence (`stardust/current/`), and state each as a **named assumption** in `direction.md` |
| `prototype` brief-confirmation waits | skip; proceed on the authored brief |
| prototype approval | granted by the agent's own judgment **only after all quality gates pass** (craft bar, validation loop, motion gates); recorded as `approvedBy: "hands-off"` on the page's `approved` history entry in `state.json` |
| `prepare-migration` phase gates | behave as `--skip-confirm` |
| `rollout` | runs full-auto end-to-end |
| `dynamics` owner decisions (backend, tags on the new host, datasource ownership, locale scope) | ship the interim tier, record each decision by name in `dynamic-features.md` and the parity report, continue; regulated-pii forms stay blocked |

Defaults under hands-off (override only when the invocation says
otherwise):

- **One canonical direction.** No variant fan-out — commit to a
  single direction and record the rationale in `direction.md`.
- **Volume caps as reasoned proposals.** Default **100 pages overall,
  20 per template**. Roster priority: (1) every page linked from the
  header and footer, (2) section landing/overview pages, (3) a
  representative spread of detail pages across all templates. State
  the chosen caps in `direction.md`.
- **Captured pages stay in the roster.** Locale is never a reason to
  drop a captured page: every `state.json` row is delivered —
  duplicate-content locale shells ride the sibling tier of their twin;
  `D3-multilingual` is for language trees that were never captured, not
  for skipping captured ones (a recorded run lost ten locale roots to an
  extract agent that hard-coded one locale).
- **Delegate by file pointer, read by section.** A brief to a delegated
  agent names the files and sections it needs (`state.json`, the page's
  schema, the phase's SKILL.md sections); it never inlines reference docs.
  Reference documents are read by heading and line range, not end to end
  (replica ships `skills/replica/scripts/section.mjs` for exactly this:
  `--list` for a document's outline, then one heading; it works on any
  Markdown file — a whole reference doc is 30–40k characters, the section
  a step needs is 2–4k, and one recorded session paid for three whole docs
  twice when their `cat` output overflowed and was re-read in full).
  Instruments that can stall run under their shipped deadline (replica
  `gate.sh`, `pixel-compare --timeout`) — never under an agent-authored
  `sleep N; kill` loop — and long steps write a progress file the
  coordinator polls instead of blocking on the agent. (Field evidence,
  2026-09: in one recorded run the two conversion agents the harness
  watchdog killed carried the fattest briefs and whole-document reads,
  and a lean re-dispatch finished the same pages; that conversion lost
  89 minutes to a blind wait and 30 to fixed sleeps.)
- **Wait discipline: never park the conversation past the prompt-cache
  window.** Anything expected to run longer than about 2 minutes — a gate
  round over several pages, a crawl, a batch push, a capture set, a
  delegated agent — runs in the background and writes a progress or
  summary file; the coordinator never runs it in the foreground and never
  covers it with one long `sleep`. While it runs, do independent work;
  when there is none, check back with one short read of the progress
  file **at most every 4 minutes** — never a fixed `sleep` of 5 minutes or
  more, and never a blocking "wait for the agent's output" call with a
  long timeout. The number is not taste: the prompt cache expires after
  5 idle minutes, and at the 500–900k-token contexts a migration reaches,
  every expiry re-writes the whole prefix at write price (12× a cached
  read). Field data, 48 sessions: a foreground wait of ≤ 4 minutes missed
  the cache in ~10 % of cases, ≥ 5 minutes in 85–87 %; 572 such
  agent-side waits re-wrote 325 M tokens — 46 % of everything those
  sessions wrote to the cache. Ending the turn to wait for a completion
  notification helps the user, not the cache: a notification that arrives
  after 5 minutes misses too (137 recorded), so prefer short checks for
  waits under ~45 minutes and end the turn only when the wait is longer
  or the user should decide. (Claude Code: `run_in_background: true` on
  the shell call, the harness posts a task notification when it exits;
  `promptCacheTtl: "1h"` in settings.json stretches the window to an hour
  at 1.6× write price — an owner setting, worth it for any multi-hour
  session.)
  The harness-neutral form of the same rule is replica's `run-bg.mjs`:
  `start` detaches the instrument, `wait` returns within `--max` (default
  100 s, ceiling 110 s — inside the shell tool's ~2-minute default timeout,
  which applies only to a call that declares none) with verdict lines
  only, exit 75 = still going, `wait` again as the NEXT call — never in a
  shell loop, never after a `sleep`. The rule binds the main agent as it
  binds subagents: one long instrument in the foreground, or two long
  instruments as parallel tool calls in one turn, is the same blocked step
  (recorded: a 338 s main-agent turn cost one full cache re-write).
- **One shell, one working directory.** The harness's shell keeps its
  working directory from one tool call to the next: a `cd` inside a
  command moves every later command with it, and a path written from
  the project root then fails from wherever the previous call ended.
  Write paths from the project root (or absolute), and confine any `cd`
  to a subshell — `(cd stardust/current && …)`. (Field evidence,
  2026-09: one `cd` into the capture directory failed the next three
  reads and cost a re-run turn.)
- **Author large files in parts.** Write the skeleton, then append in
  edits of roughly 150 lines or less, so no single turn generates for
  longer than the prompt cache lives (about five minutes); a turn that
  outruns it leaves the next request with a cold cache and re-writes
  the whole context. (Field evidence, 2026-09: in one recorded run two
  such turns — the brand documents written in one go at the end of
  extract, and a first prototype's whole HTML and CSS in one write —
  each cost a full re-write of a ~200k-token context; an earlier run
  re-wrote 513k and 694k the same way. No compaction was involved; the
  sessions simply outran the cache lifetime inside one generation.)
- **Commit at the end of each phase** when the project is a git repo.
  Before the FIRST such commit, re-run Setup step 6 — the first commit
  lands at the end of the audit phase, long before deploy's SKILL.md is
  read, and a tracked `.env` poisons every later push (GH013 + history
  rewrite at deploy time).

**Hard blockers remain stops.** An unreachable source site, an
expired `DA_TOKEN` that cannot be recovered, or a signal-absent brand
surface (extract captured no usable brand signal even after a re-run)
are not judgment calls — state the blocker precisely, append
`event: "blocked"` to `stardust/status.jsonl`, and halt. Never guess
around a hard blocker.

**Quality gates NEVER weaken under hands-off.** Provenance
validation, the validation loop, fidelity gates, delivery gates, and
rollout's optimize gate all run unchanged. Hands-off changes *who
answers*, not *what must pass*.

## The "open and reasoned" principle

Stardust does not ship a closed `intent → commands` lookup. Every freeform
phrase is reasoned about in public. You must:

1. Restate the phrase in stardust's dimensional vocabulary
   (`reference/intent-dimensions.md`).
2. Identify which axes the phrase moves and in which direction.
3. Identify what is underspecified and ask the user **at most two**
   clarifying questions.
4. Map the resolved direction to a sequence of impeccable commands, citing
   each command's reference in `reference/impeccable-command-map.md`.
5. Show the proposed plan to the user before executing.
6. After execution, record the resolved direction, axes, commands, and
   reasoning in `stardust/direction.md` with a stardust provenance block.

Worked examples of this procedure live in `reference/intent-examples.md`.

## Per-page state and "stale on direction change"

Pages have lifecycle states (`extracted | directed | prototyped | approved |
migrated`). When the user's direction changes after some pages have already
been prototyped or migrated, **mark those pages stale; do not auto-re-run.**
The user opts in to re-prototyping or re-migrating explicitly. Details in
`reference/state-machine.md`.

## Artifacts you read and write

Stardust state lives under `stardust/`. Impeccable's `PRODUCT.md` /
`DESIGN.md` / `DESIGN.json` live at the project root and represent the
*target* state. The current (extracted) state lives under
`stardust/current/`. Full layout in `reference/artifact-map.md`.

**Write boundary.** Stardust writes to `stardust/`, the impeccable target
files at the project root, and the EDS project (only via `deploy`,
`rollout`, `dynamics`). Run-only files — logs, harness page, pre-renders,
script copies, drafts — go under `stardust/.work/<skill>/`; the root
`scripts/` and `qa/` are not stardust's. Anything written elsewhere is a
bug in that skill.

**Versioning.** Everything under `stardust/` is committed except what
`reference/stardust.gitignore` lists: screenshots, four heavy folders
(`current/assets/`, `replica/gates/`, `migrated/assets/`, `rollout/qa/`),
`.work/`, run residue, session state. Per-directory table and what a clone
without `current/assets/` can and cannot do: `reference/artifact-map.md`
§ Versioning.

## Provenance

Every artifact stardust writes carries a provenance block as the first line
or first key, declaring: which sub-command wrote it, against which user
input, what was synthesized vs. authored, and what other artifacts were
read. Format conventions in `reference/artifact-map.md`.

## Journal rule

A multi-session stardust project benefits from a **chronological journal**
that records the prompt history, decisions, and open questions across
turns — separate from the state machine and from per-artifact provenance.
State.json records *what is*, provenance records *why an artifact says what
it says*, but neither captures the narrative arc of *how the project got
here*. The journal does.

**Maintain `stardust/journal.md` per the format in
`reference/journal-format.md`.** On every prompt execution that resulted in
a non-trivial write (any `direct`, `prototype`, `migrate`, or substantial
iteration), append an entry before ending the turn.

**Named deviations.** Any agent-authored crawler, compiler, importer,
wave driver or gate that replaces a skill phase is recorded in
`stardust/direction.md` as a **named deviation** — what it replaces, why
the shipped instrument did not serve, where the replacement lives — and
noted in the journal entry. An unrecorded parallel pipeline is a defect,
not initiative: three recorded migrations rebuilt the import pipeline by
hand (one a 60 KB importer) beside skills that shipped it, and their
fidelity numbers were never comparable to the gate's.

The journal is **append-only**. If a prior entry turns out wrong, write a
new entry that corrects it; do not edit history. This preserves the
reasoning trace and lets reviewers see how decisions evolved.

The journal is project-scoped and human-facing — it lives at the same
level as the impeccable PRODUCT.md, not under `stardust/current/` or
`stardust/canon/`. Treat it as the shared narrative layer over stardust's
state machine.

When the user invokes stardust at the start of a new session, the journal
is read first (along with state.json) — its last 3-5 entries carry the
"where did we leave off" context that the state machine doesn't.

## Validation rule

Every artifact stardust writes that a human will eyeball — proposed HTML,
brand-review.html, the migrated site — runs through a **recursive validate-
and-fix loop** before being marked done. The principle: type checks and
test suites verify code correctness; only browser rendering verifies
*feature* correctness.

For HTML the user will see (prototypes, migrated pages, the brand-review
HTML):

1. Render in Playwright (file:// for static, or local dev server).
2. Capture at three viewports — desktop **1440×900**, tablet **768×1024**,
   mobile **390×844**:
   - Full-page screenshot.
   - Browser console messages (errors + warnings).
   - Network failures (4xx / 5xx / aborted requests, missing assets).
   - Uncaught JS exceptions + unhandled promise rejections.
   - Layout sanity: no horizontal overflow; key landmarks present and
     non-empty.
   - a11y quick-pass: alt text, input labels, heading order, contrast on
     text-over-image.
   - Interaction smoke: hover an interactive card, scroll-trigger fires,
     nav opens/closes, primary CTA reachable by keyboard.
3. **If any issue is found, fix it and re-run the loop.** Iterate
   recursively until either (a) no issues remain or (b) the fix needs user
   input — in which case surface the question and stop. Do not report a
   task complete with known issues outstanding.
4. Save the final clean-pass screenshots to `stardust/validation/<artifact>/<viewport>.png`
   so reviewers can compare without re-running.

Per-sub-skill validation specifics live in each skill's reference docs —
notably `extract/reference/playwright-recipe.md` (the canonical recipe),
`prototype/reference/motion-validation.md` (motion-specific gates), and
`prototype/SKILL.md` Phases 2.5–2.8 (the critique / audit / adapt /
motion gate cascade).

## What stardust never does

- Invent design opinions that contradict impeccable's hard rules. Defer to
  impeccable.
- Execute a redesign plan without showing it first (hands-off mode records
  the plan in `stardust/direction.md` instead of waiting — § Hands-off mode).
- Force a re-run on stale pages without explicit user opt-in.
- Crawl an existing site beyond the user's confirmed page cap (an explicit `--pages` list is itself the confirmed scope — listed pages are never dropped; the crawler warns rather than truncates when the list exceeds `--max`).
- Emit platform-specific output from `migrate`. `migrate` emits
  platform-agnostic static HTML; the EDS conversion and delivery are owned
  by the stardust `deploy` (one page) and `rollout` (whole site) skills
  sub-skills, routed above.

- `reference/run-status.md` — the `stardust/status.jsonl` phase-transition contract every skill appends to. The deterministic progress surface for any harness.
- `reference/learnings.md` — the per-run learnings ledger contract (`stardust/learnings.md`). rollout's report phase writes it; plugin maintainers harvest pending entries into skill diffs.

### Cinematic-feature references (cross-cutting)

Owned by `prototype/` because the cinematic feature is scoped to
prototype rendering, but cited by `direct` (when selecting a
register), `uplift` (when picking C's register), and `migrate`
(when copying motion assets through):

- `../prototype/reference/motion-registers.md` — five brand-faithful motion personalities (`arrival`, `kinetic-display`, `live-systems`, `editorial`, `kinetic-grid`) and the selection heuristic that maps PRODUCT.md Brand Personality traits to a register.
- `../prototype/reference/motion-stack.md` — technology choice: Lenis + CSS keyframes + rAF + IntersectionObserver. Why not GSAP. Bundle policy.
- `../prototype/reference/motion-attributes.md` — `data-*` vocabulary the runtime consumes (`[data-anim]`, `[data-tile-anim]`, `[data-countup]`, `[data-flip]`, `[data-fill]`, `[data-split]`, `[data-parallax]`).
- `../prototype/reference/motion-runtime.md` — the canonical inline runtime script that powers every cinematic prototype.
- `../prototype/reference/motion-validation.md` § Pass 6 — cinematic-mode validation gates (Lenis boot, reduced-motion fallback, scroll-jack, three-position screenshots, register-match, motion C-cliff detector).

### Uplift-feature references

Owned by `uplift/`. Cited by master routing when delegating
`$stardust uplift <URL>`:

- `../uplift/SKILL.md` — one-shot presales orchestrator: extract → tension/trait identification → 3-variant direction → prototype × 3 → open + summarize.
- `../uplift/reference/what-if-candidates.md` — catalog of 8 worked captured-trait amplification candidates that B and C select from in Phase 2b — plus its § Extension rule admitting evidence-shaped `derived` candidates.
