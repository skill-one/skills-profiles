# AEM Workflow Triaging — 6.5 LTS / AMS

Classify workflow issues, determine what logs and data to gather, and map to the correct runbook or log search. Optimized for **production support** on **AEM 6.5 LTS** and **Adobe Managed Services (AMS)**.

## Audience

AEM 6.5 LTS / AMS operators and developers (and the IDE LLM acting on their behalf) classifying workflow incidents across one or more hosts — using host + time-range + logs (direct filesystem, AMS log access, or Splunk) and read-only JMX metrics, before drilling into a single instance. Use this skill for cross-host log mining and symptom classification; switch to `workflow-debugging` once the instance and root cause are identified.

## Variant Scope

- This skill is **6.5-lts-only** (includes AMS).
- Log access via direct filesystem (`crx-quickstart/logs/error.log`), AMS log access, or Splunk (if indexed).
- JMX available via Felix Console (`/system/console/jmx`) or a JMX client for workflow counts, queue metrics, and remediation.
- **Not for AEM as a Cloud Service.** If the target is AEMaaCS, stop and use the cloud-service variant of this skill — JMX is not available on cloud production, logs are accessed via Cloud Manager (not the filesystem), and remediation lands through Git + pipeline rather than Felix Console. Several signatures and diagnostic surfaces here do not apply as written on AEMaaCS.

## Dependencies

- `workflow-debugging` — once a symptom is classified and a host/instance is identified, route here for the step-by-step runbook and remediation.
- `workflow-debugging/reference.md` — diagnostic tool pointers, JMX/config locations, log patterns, and external doc links for 6.5 LTS / AMS.

---

## When to use this skill

- User asks: "Workflow errors on &lt;host&gt; for the past X hours", "Workflow activity on &lt;host&gt;", "Why did workflow X fail?", "What should I collect to debug this workflow ticket?"
- User needs: Symptom classification, log patterns to search, Splunk queries, or required inputs for a runbook.
- Context: AEM 6.5 LTS / AMS (author/publish hostname format).

---

## Step 1: Classify symptom (symptom_id)

Map the user's description to a **symptom_id** and runbook.

| User says / observes | symptom_id | Runbook |
|----------------------|------------|---------|
| Workflow not moving to next step; stuck in Running | workflow_stuck_not_progressing | runbook-workflow-stuck.md |
| Task should be in Inbox but is not visible | task_not_in_inbox | runbook-task-not-in-inbox.md |
| Workflow should start automatically but no instance created | workflow_not_starting_launcher | runbook-launcher-not-starting.md |
| Workflow in Failed state or step shows error | workflow_fails_or_shows_error | runbook-workflow-fails-or-shows-error.md |
| Step failed after retries; failure item in Inbox | step_failed_retries_exhausted | runbook-failed-work-items.md |
| Instance Running but no current work item (inconsistent) | stale_workflow_no_work_item | runbook-stale-workflows.md |
| Too many instances; slow queries; disk/repo bloat | repository_bloat_too_many_instances | runbook-purge-and-cleanup.md |
| User cannot see work item or complete/delegate/return | user_cannot_see_or_complete_item | runbook-inbox-and-permissions.md |
| Cannot delete workflow model (running instances) | cannot_delete_model | runbook-model-delete-and-update.md |
| Jobs queued a long time; slow completion; queue depth high | slow_throughput_queue_backlog | runbook-job-throughput-and-concurrency.md |
| Auto-advance / timeout jobs not firing; participant step stuck past its configured timeout | workflow_auto_advance_failure | runbook-job-throughput-and-concurrency.md |
| New or changed workflow not starting or step not executing | workflow_setup_validation | runbook-validate-workflow-setup.md |

> Each `runbook-*.md` above is a symptom section in the [`workflow-debugging`](../workflow-debugging/SKILL.md) skill, not a separate file to open. That skill's Step 1 maps every `symptom_id` to a first action, and its numbered steps are the runbook body. Classify here, then hand off there.

> **WorkItem vs. TaskManager task — do not confuse these.** Most workflow Inbox items are workflow work items (`WorkItem`), created by Participant steps and managed by the workflow engine; they are stored under `/var/workflow/instances`, not in TaskManager. TaskManager (`/var/taskmanagement/tasks`) only holds tasks created explicitly via the Task API — used by Projects, Assets tasks, and custom integrations. Both paths are browsable in CRXDE Lite. For `task_not_in_inbox` and `user_cannot_see_or_complete_item` symptoms on a workflow: investigate the Participant step assignee configuration, Inbox filters, and workflow permissions — not TaskManager storage. Diagnosing the wrong backend wastes significant time.

---

## Step 2: Required inputs for triage

Before suggesting a runbook or Splunk search, try to obtain:

| Input | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Host / instance** | Author/publish hostname (e.g. an AMS `author`/`publish` host, or on-prem hostname). |
| **Time range** | e.g. "past 4 hours", "past 10 hours" – for log/Splunk scope. |
| **Workflow model or step name** | e.g. "Dynamic Media Reupload", "DAM Update Asset", "testmodel". |
| **Instance ID** (if known) | From Workflow Console URL or payload; ties logs to one instance. |
| **Payload path** (if known) | e.g. `/content/dam/...`; for path-related errors. |
| **Log source** | Splunk index/sourcetype, direct filesystem `error.log`, or AMS log request. |

If the user only provides host + time, respond with the **generic** workflow error searches and note that narrowing by model/instance ID will improve accuracy.

---

## Step 3: Log patterns and Splunk (what to search)

Logs on 6.5 / AMS are accessible via **direct filesystem** (`crx-quickstart/logs/error.log`), AMS log access, or **Splunk** (if indexed).

| Scenario | Primary log pattern(s) | Splunk hint |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| Step failed | `Error executing workflow step` | Add instance ID or model name to narrow. |
| Process not found | `getProcess for '*' failed` | Extract process name for OSGi check in Felix Console (`process.label`). |
| Stuck at Process step | Same as step failed + `getProcess` | Combine with payload path. |
| Stale workflow | `Cannot archive workitem` | Correlate time with instance ID. |
| Lock / throughput | `refreshing the session since we had to wait for a lock` | Timechart by host. Real lever on 6.5 is `queue.maxparallel` on the Granite Workflow Queue — see `workflow-debugging`; reduce concurrent writes to the same path. |
| Permission | `Terminate failed` / `Resume failed` / `Suspend failed` + verifyAccess | Or `AccessControlException`. Check `enforceWorkflowInitiatorPermissions`. |
| Payload path | `PathNotFoundException` + workflow/payload | Payload deleted, or launcher config path missing. |
| Launcher not starting | `Error adding launcher config` / `Error retrieving launcher config entries` | Path: `/conf/global/settings/workflow/launcher/config`. |
| Purge failure | `Workflow purge '*' :` | Filter by repository exception / invalid state. |
| Transient workflow retries exhausted | `retrys exceeded - remove isTransient` | Process step kept throwing after `cq.workflow.job.retry` retries; instance persisted for admin handling. |
| Thread pool full | `RejectedExecutionException` | `default` pool saturated with block policy `ABORT` → timeout/auto-advance jobs dropped. |
| Operation on finished instance | `Workflow is already finished` | Check logic that calls terminate/resume on a completed or aborted instance. |

**Example Splunk searches** — `<your_aem_index>` is a placeholder; substitute your organization's AEM log index:

- All workflow step errors (last 24h):
  `index=<your_aem_index> "Error executing workflow step" | table _time host message | sort - _time`
- Process not registered:
  `index=<your_aem_index> "getProcess for" "failed" | table _time host message`
- By workflow model or instance:
  `index=<your_aem_index> ("Error executing workflow step" OR WorkflowException) (message=*<modelName>* OR message=*<instanceId>*) | sort - _time`
- Lock contention:
  `index=<your_aem_index> "refreshing the session since we had to wait for a lock" | table _time host message`
- Thread pool exhaustion (auto-advance impact):
  `index=<your_aem_index> "RejectedExecutionException" | table _time host message`

> **Note:** Index names, sourcetypes, and field names are environment-specific — they depend on how your AEM logs are onboarded to Splunk. There is no fixed index; confirm the correct one with whoever owns your Splunk onboarding before running these. Narrow by host, time range, model, and instance ID — both for accuracy and to avoid over-broad data exposure.

---

## Step 4: JMX-based diagnostics

On 6.5 / AMS, JMX exposes metrics not available from logs alone, plus remediation operations. All workflow maintenance and diagnostic operations live on one MBean, `com.adobe.granite.workflow:type=Maintenance` (via `/system/console/jmx`); a second MBean, `com.adobe.granite.workflow:type=Statistics`, exposes time-series execution metrics for trend analysis.

> **Targeting the right MBean:** match the object name `com.adobe.granite.workflow:type=Maintenance` exactly (addressed URL-encoded on the JMX console as `.../jmx/com.adobe.granite.workflow:type%3DMaintenance`). A "workflow" filter over the JMX registry also returns several `com.adobe.granite.workflow.core.*` event-listener MBeans — those are not the maintenance surface, so select by the full `type=Maintenance` object name, not a name substring. The entries in the tables below are **operations** (methods to invoke, each taking an optional `model` string), not readable attributes.

**Triage is diagnostic-first — classify with read-only operations:**

| What to check | JMX operation (read-only) | Purpose |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Stale workflow count | `countStaleWorkflows(model)` | Detect stale instances without a current work item |
| Running workflow count | `countRunningWorkflows(model)` | Count active instances for a model |
| Failed workflow count | `returnFailedWorkflowCount(model)` | Count failed instances (overall or per model) |
| Queue depth | `returnWorkflowQueueInfo` | Check Granite Workflow Queue backlog |
| Job statistics | `returnSystemJobInfo` | Sling Job overall stats |
| Job topic info | `returnWorkflowJobTopicInfo` | Per-topic queued/failed/finished counts |
| Purge preview | `purgeCompleted(model, days, dryRun=true)` | Count purgeable instances **without deleting** |

**Destructive operations — do NOT run as part of triage.** The operations below change or delete production workflow data. They belong in a deliberate remediation step (see `workflow-debugging`), not in classification:

| Operation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `retryFailedWorkItems(dryRun, model)` | Replays failed work items |
| `restartStaleWorkflows(model, dryRun)` | Restarts stale instances |
| `purgeCompleted` / `purgeActive(model, days, dryRun)` | Deletes completed/active instances |
| `terminateFailedInstances(restart, dryRun, model)` | Terminates (optionally restarts) failed instances |

**Always run `dryRun=true` first, confirm the count and scope, scope by model where possible, and only execute after the root cause is fixed and with change-control approval.**

---

## Step 5: Example triage prompts and responses

| User prompt | Triage response |
|-------------|------------------|
| "Workflow errors on &lt;host&gt; for the past X hours" | Classify as workflow_fails_or_shows_error / step_failed_retries_exhausted. Search error.log or Splunk for "Error executing workflow step", "Error processing workflow job", "getProcess for … failed". Also check JMX `returnSystemJobInfo` / `returnFailedWorkflowCount` for failed counts. Route to `workflow-debugging` (symptom: workflow_fails_or_shows_error). |
| "Workflow activity on &lt;host&gt; for the past X hours" | Clarify: "activity" = counts or errors? For counts, use JMX `countRunningWorkflows`, `returnSystemJobInfo` (read-only). For errors, use log searches. |
| "Why did &lt;workflow-or-step&gt; fail? Show failure details." | Need: host, time range, and if possible instance ID. Search error.log for "Error executing workflow step" + model/step name or instance ID. Also check Felix Console → OSGi Components for `process.label`. Route to `workflow-debugging` (workflow_fails_or_shows_error). |
| "Task not in Inbox" | symptom_id: task_not_in_inbox. Confirm it is a workflow work item (`/var/workflow/instances`), not a TaskManager task. Gather: instance ID, assignee; check Inbox filters and `granite.workflow.enforceWorkitemAssigneePermissions` in Felix Console. Route to `workflow-debugging`. |
| "Workflow not starting" | symptom_id: workflow_not_starting_launcher. Search logs for launcher errors; check launcher config under `/conf/global/settings/workflow/launcher/config`. Route to `workflow-debugging`. |
| "Workflow stuck / not progressing" | symptom_id: workflow_stuck_not_progressing. Use JMX `countStaleWorkflows` to check for stale instances. If not stale, follow the decision tree by step type. Route to `workflow-debugging`. |
| "Auto-advance / timeout jobs not firing" | symptom_id: workflow_auto_advance_failure. Check the Sling Thread Pools page for `default` pool saturation and block policy `ABORT`; check the Sling Jobs page for the `com/adobe/granite/workflow/timeout/job` topic; search error.log for `RejectedExecutionException`. Route to `workflow-debugging` (job-throughput-and-concurrency). |

## Step 6: What logs and JMX can and cannot answer

**Can answer (logs + JMX on 6.5 / AMS):**

- Step failures: exception type, message, stack (by host, time, model, step).
- Process not registered: which `process.label` is missing (logs + Felix Console).
- Stuck: step errors, getProcess failures, lock wait, payload/path errors.
- Stale: JMX `countStaleWorkflows` + "Cannot archive workitem" in logs.
- Queue metrics: JMX `returnWorkflowQueueInfo`, `returnSystemJobInfo`, `returnWorkflowJobTopicInfo`.
- Running / failed instance counts: JMX `countRunningWorkflows`, `returnFailedWorkflowCount`.
- Throughput: lock wait, session refresh, JobHandler volume.
- Permission: Terminate/Resume/Suspend failed, AccessControlException.
- Payload/launcher: PathNotFoundException, launcher config errors.
- Purge preview: JMX `purgeCompleted(dryRun=true)` + "Workflow purge …" in logs.
- Thread pool state: Configuration status ZIP → `039_Sling_Thread_Pools.txt`, or the Sling Thread Pools status page.
- Config state: Felix Console or config status ZIP → `003_Configurations.txt`.

**Cannot answer directly:**

- Console state (e.g. "is there a current work item?"). Use the Workflow Console UI (`/libs/cq/workflow/admin/console/content/instances.html`).
- Runtime process step code behavior. Requires code review + log correlation.

Always pair log-based triage with read-only JMX diagnostics and the appropriate runbook in `workflow-debugging`.

## Safety & security guardrails

Triage runs against production. Keep it safe:

- **Diagnose read-only; never mutate during triage.** Classification and data-gathering use read-only JMX operations, log reads, and console status pages. The mutating operations in Step 4 (`retryFailedWorkItems`, `restartStaleWorkflows`, `purgeCompleted`, `purgeActive`, `terminateFailedInstances`) change or delete production workflow data — run them only as a deliberate remediation step (see `workflow-debugging`): `dryRun=true` first, scoped by model, after the root cause is fixed, and with change-control approval.
- **Least privilege.** Felix Console and JMX are admin-level surfaces. Restrict them to operators. Keep `/system/console` off public networks — on AMS/on-prem it must sit behind the Dispatcher deny rules and admin authentication, never reachable from publish or the internet.
- **No secrets in queries or shared logs.** Do not embed credentials, tokens, or API keys in Splunk searches or in anything pasted into a ticket; redact them if present.
- **Treat logs and thread dumps as sensitive.** `error.log`, configuration status ZIPs, and thread dumps can contain payload paths, user IDs, and application data. Share only with authorized parties and redact customer PII before attaching to a ticket.
- **Scope every search.** Narrow Splunk/log searches by host, time range, model, and instance ID — for accuracy and to minimize data exposure.
