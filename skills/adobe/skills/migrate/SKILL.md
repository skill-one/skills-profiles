description: Apply DESIGN, canon, and modules to every page in the inventory, producing a deployable static HTML site. Use to migrate or render the whole captured site into the redesigned static tree ("migrate the pages", "render the migrated site", "apply the design to all pages", "build the deployable site", "convert the approved prototype into the full site") — the page-rendering step between prototype and deploy/rollout. Three render branches (approved page, template-applied sibling, unique render), with a declared fidelity tier per page. Per-page, incremental, idempotent, content-preserving by default.

# stardust:migrate

Apply the target spec authored by `direct`, the visual canon
written by `prototype --prep`, and the brand-module catalog
extracted during `prepare-migration` to every page in the
inventory. Produces a self-contained, deployable static HTML site
under `stardust/migrated/`. Per-page, incremental, idempotent.

`migrate` is the final stardust phase. Output is platform-
agnostic HTML — downstream conversion (AEM EDS, a CMS, a
framework) is the job of a separate plugin that consumes
`migrated/` plus `DESIGN.json` plus the per-page `_meta.json`
sidecars.

## Inputs

- `<slug>` — optional positional. Migrate just this page. Without
  it, migrate every page whose status is `directed`,
  `prototyped`, or `approved` (and not `stale`).
- `--all` — migrate every page including stale ones.
- `--force` — re-migrate every page even when the idempotent
  skip would skip them.
- `--require-approved` — refuse to migrate any non-`approved`
  page. Default behaviour migrates `directed` pages too (using
  Path A′ or Path B per
  `reference/template-and-module-rendering.md`); this flag flips
  approval-gating on.
- `--strict-canon` — refuse approvals that conflict with canon.
  Default logs the deviation and continues. Useful for projects
  where canon discipline matters more than per-template
  flexibility.
- `--clean` — delete assets previously bundled but no longer
  referenced from `stardust/migrated/assets/`. Off by default
  (migrate is additive). **Implies `--force`**: every page is
  re-rendered so the run's `bundledAssets` Set is the complete
  union of currently-referenced assets — otherwise `--clean`
  would risk deleting assets still referenced by
  idempotent-skipped pages. See
  `reference/asset-bundling.md` § Stale asset cleanup.
- `--pin-timestamp <ISO8601>` — pin the migrate-provenance
  timestamp so re-runs without source changes produce byte-
  identical HTML. Default re-uses the current wall clock, which
  is fine for normal use; CI deployment fingerprinting may want
  the pin.

The mobile-adapt audit, content-sourcing scan, and placeholder
refusal are all mandatory gates — there is no `--skip-*` or
`--allow-*` flag to bypass them. If a gate refuses a page, the
remediation is to fix the proposed file (re-prototype, edit
inline, or run an impeccable command) and re-invoke migrate.

## Setup

0. **Playwright re-probe (mandatory first step).** `--no-save` playwright
   installs from earlier phases are pruned by any later real `npm i`
   (extract SKILL.md § Setup → `--no-save` installs are ephemeral). Before
   any rendering step, probe
   `node -e "import('playwright').then(()=>process.exit(0))"` from the
   project root and re-install (`npm i -D playwright --no-save
   --legacy-peer-deps`) on failure.
1. Run the master skill's setup
   (`skills/stardust/SKILL.md` § Setup). **Flow guard.** If
   `stardust/state.json` exists without `flow` and the ask is a
   migration (a URL plus "migrate" / "to EDS" / "re-platform"), do not
   run: print the two-flow table from the master skill § Two migration
   flows and hand back to its routing — the flow is chosen and stamped
   there before any sub-skill runs
   (`skills/stardust/reference/state-machine.md` § Flow keys). Under
   hands-off the master's default applies (keep-design phrase →
   `replica`, otherwise `redesign`), recorded in `direction.md`.
   (Recorded: `migrate <url>` as the first command of two same-design
   migrations led to a hand-built compiler tuned by eye instead of the
   replica gate.)
2. Verify `stardust/state.json` exists with at least one
   `directed` page.
3. Verify project-root `DESIGN.md` and `DESIGN.json` exist with
   `DESIGN.json.extensions.canon` populated.
4. Verify `stardust/canon/` exists with at least
   `header.html`, `footer.html`, `canon.css`.

   **Canon auto-bootstrap (when steps 3–4 find no canon).** The
   documented `prototype → migrate → deploy` happy path does not
   run `prepare-migration`, so a first migrate legitimately arrives
   with no canon (observed on 4 of 6 e2e sites, where every run had
   to derive canon by hand to proceed — this is the fix). When
   canon is absent **and** at least one `approved` prototype exists,
   do not stop: run the canon write-back inline from the first
   approved prototype (the canon-author, default `home`) per
   `../prototype/reference/canon-extraction.md` § Five-step
   procedure — extract `header.html` / `footer.html` / `canon.css`
   to `stardust/canon/`, pin tokens + compositional moves to
   `DESIGN.json.extensions.canon`, and record
   `canon.source: "auto-bootstrap: <slug>"`. This is exactly what
   `prototype --prep` does on first approval; migrate performs it
   on demand so the core pipeline never dead-ends. Only stop and
   recommend `$stardust prepare-migration` when canon is absent
   **and** no approved prototype exists (there is nothing to derive
   canon from). Under `state.json.handsOff` the bootstrap is
   automatic and logged; interactively, surface it as a one-line
   notice before proceeding.
5. Verify `stardust/direction.md` has an active (not pending)
   direction.
6. Read `state.json.pages[]` and partition into:
   - **inScope**: status `directed`, `prototyped`, or
     `approved`, `stale: false` (or `--all` / explicit
     `<slug>`).
   - **skipped**: everything else, with reason captured.
7. **Validate provenance on every in-scope page.** Call
   `validateProvenance(page)` per
   `skills/stardust/reference/state-machine.md` § Provenance
   validation for every page in `inScope`. Abort with the
   helper's error when any page lacks live-render evidence —
   migrating a synthesized page record produces deployable HTML
   that misrepresents the source site, the exact failure mode
   that motivated the validator. Surface `Provenance OK on N
   pages` in the migrate-plan output before Phase 1.
8. **Mobile-adapt audit on every Path A / Path A′ source.** For
   every page whose render branch consumes a proposed or
   archetype HTML file (Path A, Path A′ per
   `reference/template-and-module-rendering.md` § Render path
   selection), run the audit per `skills/prototype/SKILL.md`
   § Mobile-adapt audit:

   - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, ...">`
     present, width not pinned to a fixed pixel value.
   - At least one `@media (max-width: ...)` rule.
   - At least one mobile-targeted breakpoint at ≤ 640px.

   Refuse pages that fail — the audit is mandatory; there is no
   skip flag. The user fixes the proposed file (re-prototype or
   chat-driven impeccable command) and re-invokes migrate.
   Record the audit result per page in the migrate report and
   in the post-render `_meta.json#audit.adapt` sidecar. Path B
   (unique-renders) skips the audit because adapt hasn't run
   on those pages — a Path B page that needs mobile coverage
   gets it via `$impeccable adapt` invoked separately by the
   user. Surface this distinction in the report so it's not
   read as a silent skip.

## Procedure

### Phase 1 — Plan

**Dynamic-surface precondition (safety net).** If
`stardust/dynamic-features.md` is missing, the hand-run flow
(`extract → direct → prototype → migrate`) never passed a pre-import
gate: run the stardust `dynamics` skill Phases 1–3 now (`extract --dynamics`
for reach if needed, detector on the archetypes, triage draft, curate)
before rendering any page. Never import a site as static without a
decision per dynamic row. Per page, rows of the inventory that touch it
become `contentDeviations[]` `kind: "dynamic-dependency"` entries
(`reference/content-preservation.md § Dynamic dependencies`).

**Gated-archetype precondition (`flow: replica`).** Before rendering any
`sibling`-tier page, read `stardust/replica/progress.json`: the page
type's archetype must have a gate result at every configured breakpoint
that is `pass: true`, or over the bar with every residual carrying a
`cause` (`../replica/reference/source-fidelity-gate.md` § Residual
logging format — a documented residual is a pass with an asterisk). An
archetype never gated, or over the bar with no residual entries, blocks
its page type: report the archetype slug and `$stardust replica
<archetype>`, and render nothing for that type. The same rule guards
`rollout` Setup; the published-origin re-gate is unchanged. Thresholds
are the gate's.

Print the plan and wait for confirmation when the scope is large:

```
migrate plan
============

In scope: 127 pages
  Path A  (approved)                6 pages: home, news/post-housing-summit, news, ...
  Path A' (template-applied)      118 pages: 84 article, 5 listing, 11 program, 2 form, 16 static
  Path B  (unique)                  3 pages: 404, search, faq

Skipped:  0 stale, 0 unscoped

DESIGN.md sha:    1a2b3c4
DESIGN.json sha:  5d6e7f8
Canon shas:       header:7g8h9i  footer:9i0j1k  css:1k2l3m

Output:           stardust/migrated/  +  per-page _meta.json sidecars
Idempotent skip:  enabled (run with --force to override)

Reply "go" to proceed.
```

For 1-3 pages or `<slug>` invocation, skip the confirmation.

### Phase 2 — Per-page render

In the replica flow a sibling renders only after its archetype is deployed and gated at the
published origin (`../replica/reference/handoff-contract.md` § 3 row C, unit `C-archetype`; #126);
the render is the encoder's input, its gate is the row after PUT. For each page in scope, follow
`reference/migration-procedure.md` and
`reference/template-and-module-rendering.md`:

- **Idempotent skip check** first (sha-compare across
  `designMd`, `designJson`, `sourceCurrent`, `sourceProposed`,
  `canonShas`, `archetypeSource`).
- **Placeholder gate** (Path A and Path A′ only — pages with a
  proposed file or archetype). Refuse when `[data-placeholder]`
  elements or non-empty `_provenance.unsourcedContent[]` are
  present — the user fills the missing content in the proposed
  file before re-invoking migrate. No bypass flag.
- **Render branch selection** (LLM judgment per T&M §
  Render path selection): A / A′ / B. **Declare the page's
  `fidelityTier`** from the branch — A → `archetype` (craft-gated),
  A′ → `sibling` (canon-fork, the cheap default for breadth — variance-probed
  once per template before cloning, `reference/fidelity-tiers.md` § Sibling
  variance probe; deltas become variant classes, never per-page forks),
  B/bodyless → `thin` — per `reference/fidelity-tiers.md`. Record
  `fidelityTier`, `archetypeSource`, `template` (the archetype's slug;
  the archetype's own sidecar leaves it null), `modules[]` (the page's
  block ids — composite sections only) and `gatesPassed[]` in
  `_meta.json` so coverage shows what was craft-gated vs cloned and
  rollout groups and dedups from the sidecars, without a census.
- **Render** per the chosen branch's procedure in T&M.
- **Canon application** — chrome injection, canon.css
  injection, deviation logging.
- **Module rendering** — render module instances via
  `stardust/canon/modules/<id>.html`; bespoke slots logged
  with `data-bespoke`.
- **Apply content-preservation rules** per
  `reference/content-preservation.md`. Internal-link rewriting
  always emits migrated-tree paths; missing slugs flagged
  broken.
- **Content-count acceptance** per
  `reference/fidelity-tiers.md` § Content-count acceptance:
  compare role-classified node counts (headings, body/list
  nodes, CTAs, images) between the captured source page JSON
  and the rendered result. A count drop in any class not
  covered by a logged `contentDeviations[]` entry fails the
  page — dropped-content importer bugs must surface here,
  while the importer is still cheap to fix, not at a
  downstream fidelity gate. Record the pass in
  `_meta.json#gatesPassed[]` as `"content-count"`.
- **Compose `<head>` metadata** per
  `reference/metadata-and-jsonld.md` (five categories;
  page-type-driven JSON-LD).
- **Validate** per T&M § Validation contracts. Strict contracts
  refuse the page; soft contracts log and continue.
- **Compute output path** per migration-procedure.md
  § Output path mapping.
- **Asset bundling.** Scan the final HTML for asset references
  (six detection shapes per
  `reference/asset-bundling.md` § Detection), copy each unique
  referenced subpath from `stardust/current/assets/<subpath>` to
  `stardust/migrated/assets/<subpath>` (preserving subdir
  structure), then rewrite every reference to the root-relative
  form `/assets/<subpath>`. Cross-page dedup uses a
  module-level Set seeded from
  `state.json.migrate.bundledAssets[]`. Missing source assets
  warn-and-skip per § Edge cases; the bundle stays internally
  consistent.
- **Media reconciliation.** For every image **not** bundled to
  same-origin (reused source-CDN URLs under Mode A image-reuse),
  decide optimize/keep/rewrite/omit per
  `reference/media-reconciliation.md`. Cross-origin `<img>` kept
  as source URLs must **skip `createOptimizedPicture`** (it drops
  the `?v=` key and corrupts the rendition); broken URLs are
  repaired (missing `?`-delimiter, wrong host) or omitted, never
  shipped as `about:error`. `rollout` re-runs the authoritative
  network resolve at delivery (`media-reconcile.mjs`).
- **Cinematic sibling (when `<slug>-cinematic.html` exists).**
  Migrate consumes the STATIC prototype only — the cinematic layer
  is never merged. Copy the motion assets (`lenis.min.js`,
  `lenis.min.css`) from `stardust/prototypes/` to
  `stardust/migrated/assets/motion/` (idempotent) for downstream
  consumers (deploy/rollout decide whether to wire them), and
  record `cinematic-variant-not-consumed` in the page's
  `_meta.json#migrationDecisions[]`.
- **Write** the migrated `index.html` and the `_meta.json`
  sidecar in the same directory. Provenance block as first
  child of `<head>`. Record `assetsBundled` (count of unique
  asset refs on this page) in `_meta.json`.

The mechanics of this phase are scripted:
`node skills/migrate/scripts/migrate.mjs render <slug…|--all>` (the
project copy runs from `stardust/scripts/migrate/`) builds the page
map, places each page at its URL-literal path, rewrites internal
links, bundles assets, composes `<head>` (provenance, `:root`,
canonical and JSON-LD defaults), validates strictly and writes the
sidecar, skipping pages whose input shas are unchanged. The judgments
it cannot make are recorded on the sidecar with `gate`, `deviation`,
`decision`, `variant` and `modules` on the same script; it never
advances `pages[].status`.

**Recorded units.** A whole-site render is bookkept as units in
`stardust/migrate/progress.json`, the shape of rollout's C-deliver unit
ledger (`../replica/reference/handoff-contract.md` § 3 row C):
`units.<name>: {status: pending|running|done|failed, kind:
plan|render|assets|report, templates[], pages: n, startedAt, endedAt,
verdict}`. One `plan` unit (Phase 1), one `render` unit per template
cluster of at most ~8 siblings (`migrate.mjs render <slug…>` takes the
cluster's slug list), one `assets` unit when Phase 3 rehosts media, one
`report` unit (Phase 4). Per unit, in this order: the `progress.json`
write → the checkpoint commit → the next unit; a unit end is a safe
resume point, not a stop. A session resumed inside migrate reads the file
and runs only the units not `done`; a unit left `running` re-renders its
slugs — the driver is idempotent, unchanged pages are skipped. A recorded
run rendered 31 siblings through five parallel builders as one unit in
one session — its most expensive — with no resume point between the plan
and the final report.

### Phase 3 — Sitewide assets and bundle finalisation

Per-page asset bundling already happened in Phase 2 (every
referenced media subpath is on disk under
`stardust/migrated/assets/`). Phase 3 fills in the **sitewide
assets** that no individual page references explicitly:

1. Copy `stardust/current/assets/logo.<ext>` to
   `stardust/migrated/assets/logo.<ext>` (only if missing or
   stale). Record under `state.json.migrate.bundledAssets[]`.
2. Verify favicon variants and font files were generated by
   `prepare-migration` Phase 4. If absent, log a warning and
   continue (the migrated site renders without them, just
   missing some platform-specific affordances).
3. Add `stardust/migrated/robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`
   derived from the migrated page inventory per
   `reference/metadata-and-jsonld.md` § Sitemap entry.
4. If `--clean` was passed, compute
   `stale = priorBundle.filter(p => !bundledAssets.has(p))`
   from `state.json.migrate.bundledAssets[]` and remove each
   stale subpath from `stardust/migrated/assets/`. Record the
   deletions under `state.json.migrate.cleanedAssets[]`. Per
   `reference/asset-bundling.md` § Stale asset cleanup.
5. Verify **portability**. The bundle must work via `file://`,
   at a webserver root, and at any subpath — "one shape, works
   everywhere". Run every audit; any non-empty grep output or
   non-zero fixture exit fails the run with the cited error
   message:

   ```bash
   # No source-tree escapes
   find stardust/migrated/ -type f -name '*.html' -exec grep -l '\.\./current/' {} +
   # Error: "asset still points outside the migrated tree; rewrite via the
   #   asset-bundling pass per reference/asset-bundling.md § Detection"

   # No absolute internal references in attribute values (404 on file:// and subpath)
   grep -rE '(href|src)="/[^/]' stardust/migrated/ --include='*.html'
   # Error: "absolute href `/beers/` will 404 on file:// and on subpath hosts;
   #   rewrite via the page map per migration-procedure.md § Reference shape"

   # No absolute internal references in url() (inline style, <style> blocks, CSS)
   grep -rE 'url\(\s*["'\'']?\s*/[^/]' stardust/migrated/ --include='*.html' --include='*.css'
   # Error: "absolute url(/...) reference will 404 on file:// and on subpath hosts;
   #   rewrite via the asset-bundling pass per asset-bundling.md § Rewrite"

   # No directory-only nav (doesn't resolve on file://). Pattern accepts
   # only relative or root-absolute hrefs (./, ../, /, or bare segment)
   # so external URLs like https://google.com/ aren't false-flagged.
   grep -rE 'href="(\.{0,2}/|[a-zA-Z0-9_-])[^:"#?]*/"' stardust/migrated/ --include='*.html'
   # Error: "directory-only href `./beers/` won't resolve on file://;
   #   append the explicit index.html (or the source URL's .html leaf)
   #   per § Reference shape"

   # pageMap consistency — every internal href appears as an outputPath
   node skills/migrate/fixtures/pagemap-audit.mjs stardust/migrated/ stardust/state.json
   # Error: "internal href has no pageMap entry; link rewriting bypassed the
   #   page map per § Page map (build once, use everywhere)"

   # Headless file:// round-trip — the test that proves zip-and-deploy works
   node skills/migrate/fixtures/file-protocol-audit.mjs stardust/migrated/
   # Error: "<offending file> linked <ref> that 404s under file://; see the
   #   Playwright network log printed above"
   ```

   The audits are mandatory — there is no skip flag. The contract
   is "self-contained, zip-and-deploy" and these audits are the
   verifiers that back the claim.

Asset migration is idempotent — files are content-hashed and
copied only when missing; per-page bundling deduplicates across
the run.

### Phase 4 — State and report

Update `state.json`:

- For each successfully migrated page: `status` advances to
  `migrated`, append a history entry, clear any `stale` flag,
  set `migratedPath`.
- For pages skipped via idempotent skip: leave state
  unchanged.
- For pages that failed validation: leave state unchanged, log
  the failure in `state.json.lastRun.failures[]`.
- Write the top-level `migrate` block per
  `skills/stardust/reference/migrate-output-format.md`
  § State.json contract: `selfContained: true`, `outputDir`,
  `totalAssetsBundled`, `bundledAssets[]`, per-page
  `assetsBundled` counts, `missingAssets[]`, `cleanedAssets[]`.
  This is the forward-compat signal downstream consumers test
  for.

Print the run summary:

## Outputs

| Path                                              | Purpose                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `stardust/migrated/<source-url-path>`             | Migrated page. Output path mirrors the source URL literally (see `reference/migration-procedure.md` § Output path mapping). The bundle is **zip-and-deploy**: drop on any static host at any path, or open `index.html` directly via `file://`. Every internal reference is relative to the page that emits it; nav targets carry an explicit `index.html` (or the source URL's literal filename) so file:// resolves without a server. |
| _meta.json sidecar                                | Lives next to each migrated page. For `<dir>/index.html` the sidecar is `<dir>/_meta.json`; for `<dir>/<name>.html` the sidecar is `<dir>/<name>._meta.json` so multiple `.html` siblings don't collide. Per `reference/migration-procedure.md` § `_meta.json` sidecar. |
| `stardust/migrated/index.html`                    | The home page (special case).                          |
| `stardust/migrated/_meta.json`                    | Home sidecar.                                          |
| `stardust/migrated/assets/logo.<ext>`             | Brand logo (sitewide).                                 |
| `stardust/migrated/assets/<subpath>`              | Every asset referenced by any migrated page, bundled. Source subdir structure preserved verbatim. |
| `stardust/migrated/assets/favicon.<ext>` + variants| Favicon and apple-touch-icon, manifest icons.         |
| `stardust/migrated/assets/fonts/...`              | Downloaded font files (from canon @font-face URLs).    |
| `stardust/migrated/robots.txt`                    | Minimal robots.txt.                                    |
| `stardust/migrated/sitemap.xml`                   | Sitemap derived from migrated inventory + page types.  |
| `stardust/state.json`                             | Updated with `migrated` status, history, and the `migrate` block (`selfContained: true`, asset counts). |

The driver (`node stardust/scripts/migrate/migrate.mjs render …`) writes
the per-page rows above (`index.html` / `<name>.html`, `_meta.json`,
bundled `assets/**`) and the `migrate` block of `state.json` (`pageMap[]`,
`bundledAssets[]`, `pages[]`, `missingAssets[]`, `lastRun`); status
changes, robots.txt and sitemap.xml stay with Phases 3–4.

## Idempotent and incremental

The whole pipeline is built around two properties:

- **Idempotent.** Re-running `$stardust migrate` with no
  changes produces zero file writes. Every page is sha-compared
  across designMd, designJson, sourceCurrent, sourceProposed
  (Path A), canonShas, archetypeSource (Path A′) — and skipped
  if all match.
- **Incremental.** Migrate 5 pages today, 20 pages tomorrow,
  fix one page's content next week — the migrated tree is
  always the union of every successful migration to date.

These properties hold even when DESIGN.md, canon, or modules are
edited mid-run: the edit changes the relevant sha, so the next
migrate run re-renders every affected page (canon and DESIGN.md
edits typically affect every page).

## Stale handling

When `direction.md`, canon, or the module catalog changes after
some pages have been migrated:

- Affected pages are flagged `stale: true` per
  `skills/stardust/reference/state-machine.md` § Stale flagging.
  Stale-flagging is content-aware in all three trigger cases.
- `$stardust migrate` (no flags) skips stale pages and reports
  the count.
- `$stardust migrate --all` re-migrates each stale page,
  clearing the flag on success.
- `$stardust migrate <slug>` always operates on the named page,
  stale or not.

The user decides whether stale pages should be refreshed —
direction/canon/module changes don't invalidate prior migrated
work, they just mark it as out-of-step.

## Failure modes

- **No directed pages.** Recommend `$stardust direct` (or
  `$stardust extract` if no extracted state).
- **No DESIGN.md or DESIGN.json.** Recommend `$stardust direct`.
- **No canon, but an approved prototype exists.** Do NOT stop —
  auto-bootstrap canon from the canon-author inline (Setup step 4).
- **No canon and no approved prototype.** Recommend
  `$stardust prepare-migration` (or approve a prototype first).
- **Pending direction.** Refuse; user must resolve direction
  first.
- **Validation failure on a single page.** Skip that page,
  continue, log the failure under
  `state.json.lastRun.failures[]`. Do not abort the whole run.
- **Asset copy failure.** Continue the run; record the missing
  asset in the page's `migrationDecisions[]` with
  `kind: "asset-missing"`. The migrated `<img src>` keeps the
  original absolute URL as a fallback.
- **Output path collision.** Two slugs mapping to the same
  output path. Refuse to write the second one and surface to
  the user — manual slug rename needed.
- **Placeholder content in proposed/archetype file.** Refuse
  to ship a page whose source contains `[data-placeholder]`
  elements. Surface the unsourced list and recommend sourcing
  real content (re-prototype, or edit the proposed file
  directly). There is no bypass flag — shipping placeholders to
  a public site is the failure mode this gate exists to prevent.
- **Color reservation violated.** Refuse the page; surface to
  user with the offending color and the reserved-for context.
- **Brand-faithful inversion conflict.** A hard rule declared
  inverted in
  `extensions.divergence.brand_faithful_inversions[]` is lifted
  from validation per T&M § Brand-faithful inversion handling.
  Emit a one-line note in the run summary acknowledging the
  lift.

## What migrate does NOT do

- Critique or audit the migrated output. Run
  `$impeccable critique stardust/migrated/` after migration if
  you want a quality assessment.
- Deploy. Stardust does not push, upload, or modify origin.
- Generate AEM EDS, a CMS payload, or framework components. The
  output is platform-agnostic static HTML; downstream conversion
  is a separate plugin's job.
- Re-fetch the live site. Offline after extract Phase 1.
- Run any iteration loop. Iteration belongs to `prototype`;
  migrate consumes the result.
