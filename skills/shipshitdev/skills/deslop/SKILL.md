  Strip AI-generated slop from a codebase, product, and prose. Code slop —
  console statements, `any` types, unused imports, commented-out code, redundant
  comments, needless defensive try-catch on trusted paths, over-nesting. Product
  slop (with --product) — marketing-filler copy, generic AI phrasing,
  default-shadcn look, unstyled loading/error states, dead buttons and half-wired
  flows. UI slop (`ui`) runs a project-derived design-system primitive pass.
  Prose slop (`prose`) cuts AI tells from writing. Can scope to the current
  branch's diff or sweep the whole tree. Use when asked to clean up AI-generated
  code, unslop writing, remove slop, or make an app feel finished before
  shipping to customers.

# Deslop

AI-assisted development leaves three kinds of slop. **Code slop** compiles but
reads as machine-written. **Product slop** ships but feels unfinished to a
paying customer. **Prose slop** is writing with AI tells: puffery, em-dash
habits, chatbot phrases, voiceless neutrality. This skill removes all three.
Code slop is the default. `--product` adds the product pass. `prose` runs the
writing pass. `ui` runs only the design-system pass.

Edits and removes code, so it runs behind a confirmation gate and prefers the
branch diff. For a read-only pass that only flags, use `structural-review` /
`/review`. For a layered doc standard (Diátaxis, STE, Global English), use
`technical-writing` and then apply the prose catalog here.

Other skills that need the prose catalog point at
[references/prose-slop.md](references/prose-slop.md). They do not fire this
skill.

## Authorized Scope

Apply this engine only within the user's requested task and existing explicit
authorization. Loading or delegating to it grants no additional authority.
Preserve report-only restrictions and the caller's target, host, provider, and
cost limits. Existing approval satisfies a gate only for the same actions and
scope; obtain approval before expanding them. Forward these limits to delegates.

## Contract

Inputs:

- A package, repo, or prose surface to clean; optional scope (`--changed`,
  `all`, `dry-run`) and dimension (`--product`, `ui`, `prose`).

Outputs:

- Applied edits (or, in `dry-run`, a grouped report of what would change), plus
  a short count of artifacts removed by type.

Creates/Modifies:

- Edits source files or named prose. Never deletes entry points, configs, or
  READMEs.

External Side Effects:

- None beyond local file edits. Runs type-check and tests after code edits.

Confirmation Required:

- Before sweeping the whole tree (`all`) or rewriting product copy whose intent
  is ambiguous.

Delegates To:

- `polish` for the final micro-detail pass after the structural slop is gone.
- `refactor-code` when a fix is a real refactor, not a mechanical strip.
- `technical-writing` when the ask is a docs, RFC, README, PR, or commit
  standard rather than a slop strip.

## Code slop (default)

Remove, matching the surrounding file's existing style:

1. **Console statements** → the project logger.
2. **`any` types** → real types or `unknown` + a type guard.
3. **Unused imports / variables** → delete.
4. **Commented-out code** → delete (git remembers it).
5. **Debug / temporary code** → delete leftover TODO/FIXME debug lines.
6. **Redundant comments** — remove those that restate *what*; keep those that
   explain *why*.
7. **Needless defensive checks** — drop try-catch and null guards on trusted
   internal paths that cannot fail; keep guards on real external boundaries.
8. **Over-nesting** — collapse deep if/else pyramids into early returns.

## Prose slop (`prose`)

When the first argument is `prose`, or when the target is a reply, README,
RFC, PR description, commit message, or other writing surface, apply
[references/prose-slop.md](references/prose-slop.md).

1. Scan for the 31 patterns.
2. Rewrite. Preserve meaning. Match intended tone.
3. Add soul: opinions, varied rhythm, specific facts.
4. Self-audit: "What makes this obviously AI generated?" Fix remaining tells.

`--product` copy cleanup also runs this catalog. Do not invent product voice
when the intended copy is unclear; flag it.

## Product slop (`--product`)

The layer that decides whether an app feels finished. See
[references/product-slop.md](references/product-slop.md) for the full Incorrect
→ Correct catalog; the three families:

- **Copy** — marketing filler, generic AI phrasing, empty-states and error
  messages that say nothing useful. Run the prose catalog on every string.
- **UI** — the untouched-shadcn-plus-purple-gradient look, inconsistent
  spacing/radius, loading and error states left unstyled or absent.
- **UX** — buttons wired to nothing, flows that dead-end, placeholder pages
  behind real-looking nav, forms with no validation or success feedback.

Product slop needs judgment, not just deletion. Flag anything ambiguous rather
than guessing at intended copy or behavior.

## UI slop (`ui`)

When the first argument is `ui`, run only the UI pass. Do not run the code
cleanup workflow first.

Do not encode component-specific styling rules in this skill. Derive them from
the target project.

Before judging taste, inspect the local source of truth:

- Design docs, tokens, theme files, CSS variables, Tailwind config, or equivalent.
- Shared UI primitives such as cards, buttons, inputs, dialogs, tables, tabs,
  nav, badges, tooltips, menus, and loading states.
- Three nearby good examples in the same app or package.
- The target screen/component code and rendered output when available.

Create a short working inventory:

- Approved tokens and spacing/radius/shadow patterns.
- Shared primitives and their variants.
- UI-role map for the audited surface: primitive, documented recipe, or missing.
- Local examples that already look production-ready.
- Target files and routes affected.

For each UI role present on the audited surface, identify whether the project
has a shared primitive or documented recipe:

- Surface, card, panel.
- Button or action.
- Link or navigation.
- Input, select, textarea.
- Checkbox, radio, switch.
- Badge or status.
- Modal, dialog, drawer, popover, tooltip.
- Table, list, grid.
- Tabs or segmented controls.
- Empty, loading, error states.
- App shell, navigation, layout sections.

If a primitive exists:

- Use it instead of raw HTML, copied markup, or local styling.
- Use only its public props, variants, slots, and documented composition
  patterns.
- Do not override its core visual contract from call sites: background, border,
  radius, shadow, typography, spacing, focus, disabled, loading, or state
  styling.
- If the needed variant does not exist, add a named variant to the primitive
  only when the need is clear and reusable. Otherwise defer with a finding.

If no primitive exists:

- Follow the documented design recipe or the strongest nearby local pattern.
- If the same recipe appears repeatedly, recommend extracting a primitive or
  named variant.
- Do not invent a one-off visual treatment unless the user explicitly requested
  a bespoke design.

Raw semantic HTML is fine for document structure and prose. Raw HTML is not
fine when it is acting as a design-system control or surface.

Fix objective design-system drift before subjective taste. Keep changes scoped
to the audited surface and defer product-judgment calls with a concrete finding
instead of inventing intent.

## Workflow

1. **Route mode** — `ui` runs the UI pass and stops. `prose` runs the prose
   catalog and stops. `--product` adds product + prose after code slop.
2. **Detect structure** — monorepo vs single package
   (`ls packages/ 2>/dev/null`). Process each package separately.
3. **Scope** — in `--changed`, limit edits to the branch diff:

   ```bash
   BASE="$(git merge-base HEAD origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master)"
   git diff --name-only "$BASE"..HEAD    # files this branch touched
   ```

   Touch only those files/hunks; do not clean pre-existing slop elsewhere in
   this mode.
4. **Strip** by the categories above.
5. **Verify** — a code change must still build and pass:

   ```bash
   bun run type-check || bunx tsc --noEmit
   bun run test
   ```

6. **Document** — log packages cleaned and per-type counts in the current
   repository's session log when one exists.

## Modes

- **default** — code slop, current package, edits applied.
- **`ui`** — run the UI/design-system primitive pass.
- **`prose`** — run the writing-tell catalog only.
- **`--changed`** — only the files/hunks this branch introduced (safest for a PR).
- **`--product`** — add the product-slop pass (copy/UI/UX) and the prose catalog.
- **`all`** — sweep every package in a monorepo, each processed separately.
- **`dry-run`** — detect only; report every artifact grouped by type with
  counts, edit nothing. Combines with any scope.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Cleaning the whole tree when a branch scope was meant** — `--changed`
  keeps a PR reviewable; whole-tree edits need confirmation.
- **Deleting side-effect imports** (CSS, polyfills) or critical files
  (README, configs, entry points).
- **Removing a "why" comment** because it looks redundant — only
  *what*-restating comments go.
- **Guessing at product copy or intended behavior** — flag ambiguous product
  slop for the user instead of inventing a fix.
- **Rewriting logic under the banner of cleanup** — a behavior change is a
  refactor (`refactor-code`), not deslop.
- **Leaving voiceless prose after the strip** — sterile writing is still slop.
