# Commit Summary

Generate accurate Conventional Commits from real git diffs.

## Authorized Scope

Apply this engine only within the user's requested task and existing explicit
authorization. Loading or delegating to it grants no additional authority.
Preserve report-only restrictions and the caller's target, host, provider, and
cost limits. Existing approval satisfies a gate only for the same actions and
scope; obtain approval before expanding them. Forward these limits to delegates.

## Contract

Inputs:

- Repository root
- Staged changes, unstaged changes, or approved paths to stage
- Optional commit type, scope, and breaking-change context

Outputs:

- Commit message candidate
- Logical commit grouping when changes are mixed
- Created commit hash after approval, if requested

Creates/Modifies:

- No changes in message-only mode
- May stage files and create commits after approval

External Side Effects:

- None unless another workflow pushes the commit later

Confirmation Required:

- Before staging files
- Before creating a commit
- Before amending or squashing existing commits

Delegates To:

- `github-pr-publish` when the commit should be pushed and opened as a PR
- `git-safety` when secrets or sensitive files appear in the diff

## Workflow

1. Inspect repository state:

   ```bash
   git status -sb
   git log --oneline -5
   git diff --stat
   git diff --cached --stat
   ```

2. Determine whether changes are already staged:
   - If staged changes exist, generate the message from `git diff --staged`.
   - If nothing is staged, inspect unstaged changes and propose logical groups.
   - If unrelated changes are mixed, recommend separate commits.

3. Guard against unsafe commits:
   - Do not stage secrets, `.env`, credentials, private keys, local databases,
     build caches, or large generated artifacts.
   - If sensitive files appear, stop and delegate to `git-safety`.
   - Do not include unrelated formatting churn in a feature/fix commit unless
     it is required by the change.

4. Choose the Conventional Commit type:

   - `feat`: user-visible feature or capability
   - `fix`: bug fix
   - `docs`: documentation only
   - `style`: formatting only, no behavior change
   - `refactor`: code restructuring without behavior change
   - `perf`: performance improvement
   - `test`: tests only
   - `build`: build system, package manager, dependencies
   - `ci`: CI/CD workflow changes
   - `chore`: maintenance with no user-facing behavior
   - `revert`: revert a previous commit

5. Detect scope:
   - Prefer package, app, domain, or subsystem names already used in history.
   - Omit scope if it would be vague (`misc`, `stuff`, `changes`).

6. Detect breaking changes:
   - Public API contract changes
   - CLI flags or output changes
   - Database/schema migrations requiring user action
   - Removed config keys, env vars, routes, events, or exported symbols

   Format as `type(scope)!: summary` and include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

7. Generate the commit message:

   ```text
   type(scope): imperative summary

   Optional body explaining why and any non-obvious implementation detail.

   Optional footer such as:
   BREAKING CHANGE: migration required because ...
   Refs: #123
   ```

8. If the user asked to commit, show the exact message and proceed within that
   authorization. Obtain approval only if the selected files or operation exceed
   the request:

   ```bash
   git add <approved-paths>
   git diff --staged --stat
   git commit -m "<subject>" -m "<body-or-footer>"
   ```

## Quality Bar

- Subject is imperative and under 72 characters.
- Body explains why when the diff alone is not enough.
- Message does not overstate behavior.
- Commit contains one logical change.
- Verification commands are not placed in the commit message unless the repo
  convention asks for them.

## Gotchas

- **`git add .` can stage unintended files.** If `.gitignore` does not exclude `node_modules`, `.env*`, or build artifacts, always prefer `git add <specific-paths>`. Verify with `git diff --staged --stat` before committing.
- **Breaking-change footer is case-sensitive.** The token must be exactly `BREAKING CHANGE:` (with a space, all caps) for tools like `semantic-release` and `conventional-changelog` to detect it. `BREAKING-CHANGE:` is not equivalent.
- **Amended commits rewrite history.** Never amend a commit that has already been pushed to a shared branch. If the commit exists on the remote, create a new fix commit instead.
- **Co-authored-by trailers conflict with repo conventions.** Some repos (including this project) explicitly forbid `Co-Authored-By` trailers. Check the repo's agent instruction file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent) or recent commit history for the project convention before adding them.

## Examples

- `feat(auth): add password reset flow`
- `fix(api): handle null provider response`
- `ci(actions): restrict pull request token permissions`
- `refactor(utils): extract date formatting helper`
- `docs: update GitHub project board workflow`
