# Teach

Explain what a thing is, how it works, and why it is built that way,
in one plain account at the person's pace. Change nothing.

## Authorized Scope

Apply this engine only within the user's requested task and existing explicit
authorization. Loading or delegating to it grants no additional authority.
Preserve report-only restrictions and the caller's target, host, provider, and
cost limits. Existing approval satisfies a gate only for the same actions and
scope; obtain approval before expanding them. Forward these limits to delegates.

## Contract

Inputs:

- A change, subsystem, or concept the person wants to understand

Outputs:

- The explanation itself, never a report about what you delivered

Creates/Modifies:

- None

External Side Effects:

- None beyond the read-only work `how` and `why` do

Confirmation Required:

- None

Delegates To:

- `how` and `why` for investigation. Do not redo their digging.

## Steps

1. Decide the few things they should walk away understanding, from why
   they are asking and what they already know. Do not quiz them.
2. Let `how` and `why` do the work. Run them in parallel when both
   matter. Keep `why` narrow by default. Keep `why`'s confidence
   language intact.
3. Start with a plain definition. Then tie it to the case in front of
   you. Give the smallest complete answer first, a sentence or two,
   then stop. Add layers when they ask.
4. Keep it a conversation. No quizzes. No pacing theater. No
   "the key insight" labels.
5. Show, don't only tell. For three or more moving parts, draw a short
   series of diagrams that each add one part. Mermaid for flows. Skip
   a figure that only decorates.

Apply `references/prose-slop.md` from the selected `deslop` skill directory. Give each concept one
name and keep it.

**Reply:** the explanation. Lead with the main point, then what it is,
how it works, and why.
