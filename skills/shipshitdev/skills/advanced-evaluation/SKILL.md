# Advanced Evaluation

**Key insight**: LLM-as-a-Judge is not a single technique but a family of approaches, each suited to different evaluation contexts. Choosing the right approach and mitigating known biases is the core competency this skill develops.

## When to Activate

- Building LLM-as-judge systems for LLM outputs
- Comparing multiple model responses to select the best one
- Establishing consistent quality standards across evaluation teams
- Debugging evaluation systems that show inconsistent results
- Designing A/B tests for prompt or model changes
- Creating rubrics specifically for LLM or human/LLM hybrid judges
- Analyzing correlation between automated and human judgments

Do not activate this skill for adjacent work owned by other skills:

- General deterministic checks, regression suites, production quality gates, or outcome metrics: `evaluation`.
- Tool API contracts for evaluation tools: `tool-design`.

## Core Concepts

### The Evaluation Taxonomy

Select between two primary approaches based on whether ground truth exists:

**Direct Scoring** — Use when objective criteria exist (factual accuracy, instruction following, toxicity). A single LLM rates one response on a defined scale. Achieves moderate-to-high reliability for well-defined criteria. Watch for score calibration drift and inconsistent scale interpretation.

**Pairwise Comparison** — Use for subjective preferences (tone, style, persuasiveness). An LLM compares two responses and selects the better one. Pairwise methods often correlate better with human preference than open-ended direct scoring for subjective tasks (claim-advanced-evaluation-position-swap). Watch for position bias and length bias.

### The Bias Landscape

Mitigate these systematic biases in every evaluation system:

**Position Bias**: First-position responses get preferential treatment. Mitigate by evaluating twice with swapped positions, then apply majority vote or consistency check.

**Length Bias**: Longer responses score higher regardless of quality. Mitigate by explicitly prompting to ignore length and applying length-normalized scoring.

**Self-Enhancement Bias**: Models rate their own outputs higher. Mitigate by using different models for generation and evaluation.

**Verbosity Bias**: Excessive detail scores higher even when unnecessary. Mitigate with criteria-specific rubrics that penalize irrelevant detail.

**Authority Bias**: Confident tone scores higher regardless of accuracy. Mitigate by requiring evidence citation and adding a fact-checking layer.

### Metric Selection Framework

Match metrics to the evaluation task structure:

| Task Type | Primary Metrics | Secondary Metrics |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Binary classification (pass/fail) | Recall, Precision, F1 | Cohen's kappa |
| Ordinal scale (1-5 rating) | Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau | Cohen's kappa (weighted) |
| Pairwise preference | Agreement rate, Position consistency | Confidence calibration |
| Multi-label | Macro-F1, Micro-F1 | Per-label precision/recall |

Prioritize systematic disagreement patterns over absolute agreement rates because a judge that consistently disagrees with humans on specific criteria is more problematic than one with random noise.

## Evaluation Approaches

### Direct Scoring Implementation

Build direct scoring with three components: clear criteria, a calibrated scale, and structured output format.

**Criteria Definition Pattern**:

```
Criterion: [Name]
Description: [What this criterion measures]
Weight: [Relative importance, 0-1]
```

**Scale Calibration** — Choose scale granularity based on rubric detail:

- 1-3: Binary with neutral option, lowest cognitive load
- 1-5: Standard Likert, best balance of granularity and reliability
- 1-10: Use only with detailed per-level rubrics because calibration is harder

Require evidence before the score in scoring prompts so the judge must anchor its decision in observable output features before emitting a number. See `references/examples.md` (§ Direct Scoring Prompt Template) for the full prompt.

### Pairwise Comparison Implementation

Apply position bias mitigation in every pairwise evaluation:

1. Run deterministic pre-checks first: both candidates must satisfy the same schema, source-evidence requirements, and scope constraints.
2. First judge pass: Response A in first position, Response B in second.
3. Second judge pass: Response B in first position, Response A in second.
4. Consistency check: If passes disagree, return TIE with reduced confidence.
5. Final verdict: Consistent winner with averaged confidence and explicit tie-breaker rationale.

**Confidence Calibration** — map confidence to position consistency: both passes agree → confidence = average of individual confidences; passes disagree → confidence = 0.5, verdict = TIE. See `references/examples.md` (§ Pairwise Comparison Prompt Template) for the full prompt.

### Rubric Generation

Generate rubrics to reduce evaluation variance compared to open-ended scoring. Treat exact variance reduction as workload-specific unless measured on the target eval set.

**Include these rubric components**:

1. **Level descriptions**: Clear boundaries for each score level
2. **Characteristics**: Observable features that define each level
3. **Examples**: Representative text for each level (optional but valuable)
4. **Edge cases**: Guidance for ambiguous situations
5. **Scoring guidelines**: General principles for consistent application

**Set strictness calibration** for the use case:

- **Lenient**: Lower passing bar, appropriate for encouraging iteration
- **Balanced**: Typical production expectations
- **Strict**: High standards for safety-critical or high-stakes evaluation

Adapt rubrics to the domain — use domain-specific terminology. A code readability rubric mentions variables, functions, and comments. A medical accuracy rubric references clinical terminology and evidence standards.

## Practical Guidance

### Evaluation Pipeline Design

Build production evaluation systems with these layers: Criteria Loader (rubrics + weights) -> Primary Scorer (direct or pairwise) -> Bias Mitigation (position swap, etc.) -> Confidence Scoring (calibration) -> Output (scores + justifications + confidence). See [Evaluation Pipeline Diagram](./references/evaluation-pipeline.md) for the full visual layout.

### Decision Framework: Direct vs. Pairwise

Apply this decision tree:

```
Is there an objective ground truth?
+-- Yes -> Direct Scoring
|   Examples: factual accuracy, instruction following, format compliance
|
+-- No -> Is it a preference or quality judgment?
    +-- Yes -> Pairwise Comparison
    |   Examples: tone, style, persuasiveness, creativity
    |
    +-- No -> Consider reference-based evaluation
        Examples: summarization (compare to source), translation (compare to reference)
```

### Scaling Evaluation

For high-volume evaluation, apply one of these strategies:

1. **Panel of LLMs (PoLL)**: Use multiple models as judges and aggregate votes to reduce individual model bias. More expensive but more reliable for high-stakes decisions.

2. **Hierarchical evaluation**: Use a fast cheap model for screening and an expensive model for edge cases. Requires calibration of the screening threshold.

3. **Human-in-the-loop**: Automate clear cases and route low-confidence decisions to human review. Design feedback loops to improve automated evaluation over time.

## Examples

Three worked examples — direct scoring for factual accuracy, pairwise comparison with position swap, and rubric generation — are in `references/examples.md` (§ Example 1-3).

## Guidelines

1. **Always require evidence before scores** - Evidence-first prompts make judgments easier to audit and reduce ungrounded numeric scoring

2. **Always swap positions in pairwise comparison** - Single-pass comparison is corrupted by position bias

3. **Match scale granularity to rubric specificity** - Don't use 1-10 without detailed level descriptions

4. **Separate objective and subjective criteria** - Use direct scoring for objective, pairwise for subjective

5. **Include confidence scores** - Calibrate to position consistency and evidence strength

6. **Define edge cases explicitly** - Ambiguous situations cause the most evaluation variance

7. **Use domain-specific rubrics** - Generic rubrics produce generic evaluations

8. **Validate against human judgments** - Automated evaluation is only valuable if it correlates with human assessment

9. **Monitor for systematic bias** - Track disagreement patterns by criterion, response type, model

10. **Design for iteration** - Evaluation systems improve with feedback loops

## Gotchas

1. **Scoring without justification**: Scores lack grounding and are difficult to debug. Always require evidence-based justification before the score.

2. **Single-pass pairwise comparison**: Position bias corrupts results when positions are not swapped. Always evaluate twice with swapped positions and check consistency.

3. **Overloaded criteria**: Criteria that measure multiple things at once produce unreliable scores. Enforce one criterion = one measurable aspect.

4. **Missing edge case guidance**: Evaluators handle ambiguous cases inconsistently without explicit instructions. Include edge cases in rubrics with clear resolution rules.

5. **Ignoring confidence calibration**: High-confidence wrong judgments are worse than low-confidence ones. Calibrate confidence to position consistency and evidence strength.

6. **Rubric drift**: Rubrics become miscalibrated as quality standards evolve or model capabilities improve. Schedule periodic rubric reviews and re-anchor score levels against fresh human-annotated examples.

7. **Evaluation prompt sensitivity**: Minor wording changes in evaluation prompts can cause material score swings. Version-control evaluation prompts and run regression tests before deploying prompt changes.

8. **Uncontrolled length bias**: Longer responses systematically score higher even when conciseness is preferred. Add explicit length-neutrality instructions to evaluation prompts and validate with length-controlled test pairs.

## Integration

This skill owns judge design and bias mitigation. Adjacent skills own broader quality gates and infrastructure:

- `evaluation`: general deterministic checks, regression suites, quality gates, and production monitoring.
- `context-fundamentals`: context structure for judge prompts.
- `tool-design`: schemas and error handling for evaluation tools.
- `context-optimization`: token and latency efficiency for high-volume evals.
