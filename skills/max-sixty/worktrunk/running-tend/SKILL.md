# Worktrunk Tend CI

Project-specific guidance for tend workflows running on worktrunk (a Rust
CLI for managing git worktrees). The generic skills
(`/tend-ci-runner:run-tend`, `/tend-ci-runner:review`,
`/tend-ci-runner:triage`, etc.) provide the workflow framework; this skill
adds worktrunk conventions.

## Filing issues in other repos

Standing exception granted: file directly in agent-equipped targets (per
**Filing issues** in the bundled `/tend-ci-runner:act-in-other-repos` skill)
without asking permission here first. The default rule (open an issue here asking
permission first) still applies when the target shows no agent signals.

## Codecov Monitoring

After required CI checks pass, poll `codecov/patch` — it is mandatory despite
being marked non-required:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 5); do
  CODECOV=$(gh pr checks <number> 2>&1 | grep 'codecov/patch' || true)
  if echo "$CODECOV" | grep -q 'pass'; then
    echo "codecov/patch passed"; exit 0
  elif echo "$CODECOV" | grep -q 'fail'; then
    echo "codecov/patch FAILED"; exit 1
  fi
  sleep 60
done
```

If codecov fails **locally**, investigate with `task coverage` and
`cargo llvm-cov report --show-missing-lines | grep <file>`.

### Investigating codecov failures in CI

`task` and `cargo-llvm-cov` are not installed in the `tend-setup` action.
Don't try to `cargo install` them in the sandbox — past attempts at
source-compiling installs cascaded into bash-tool interrupts that blocked
even `pwd` and `echo`. Instead, query Codecov directly, following
`tests/AGENTS.md` → **Coverage Investigation** for the endpoints and their
traps. The scratch paths there and below go to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` — write new
ones the same way.

If the Codecov API markers aren't enough, download the `code-coverage-report`
artifact from the PR head's `coverage` workflow run — it contains a
`cobertura.xml` with per-line hit counts:

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
# Find the coverage run on the PR head SHA:
CI_RUN=$(gh api "repos/$REPO/commits/<sha>/check-runs" --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.name == "code-coverage") | .details_url | capture("runs/(?<id>[0-9]+)") | .id')
# List artifacts, then download the coverage one:
gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/runs/$CI_RUN/artifacts" --jq '.artifacts[] | {name, id}'
gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/artifacts/<id>/zip" > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/coverage.zip"
unzip -q "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/coverage.zip" -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/coverage"
```

## Test Commands

```bash
cargo run -- hook pre-merge --yes   # full suite + lints
cargo test --lib --bins             # unit tests only
cargo test --test integration       # integration tests only
```

CI runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Rework a test that reaches for its environment

A test that leans on inherited state — the process CWD, an ambient env var —
sets up its own instead, via `TestRepo::with_initial_commit()` plus a tempdir,
the way most worktrunk tests already do. Guarding it with an early return
(**Don't "fix" tests by adding skip guards** in `/tend-ci-runner:fix-a-bug`)
drops the coverage rather than restoring it. This governs every workflow that
fixes a test here, not just issue triage.

## Session Log Paths

The artifact directory is named after the agent's working directory, which
moves between tend releases — 0.2.5–0.2.13 used a per-run
`tend-agent-workspace-*/checkout`, and from 0.2.14 the agent works in the
runner's own checkout, so `-home-runner-work-worktrunk-worktrunk/` is the
prefix again. Match on neither literal: use the bundled
`find "$DEST" -name '*.jsonl'` recipe, which holds across all of them — every
shape is one `<session-id>.jsonl` under a single slugified directory.

## Labels

- `automated-fix` — fix PRs from triage and ci-fix workflows
- `nightly-cleanup` — nightly sweep issues and PRs

## CI Fix: Prefer Rerun for Transient Infrastructure Failures

Before opening a `fix/ci-*` PR, classify the failure:

- **Transient infrastructure** (link-check timeouts, apt-get flakes, GitHub
  outages, runner disk issues, codecov upload blips) — do **not** create a
  PR. The maintainer will rerun CI. Comment on the run or exit silently; a
  permanent config change for a one-off timeout is churn the maintainer will
  close.
- **Flaky test** (known-flaky or first-seen PTY/shell test) — try to fix it.
- **Real regression** — proceed with a fix PR.

**Non-required ≠ transient.** A non-required job (e.g. `collect affected coverage`, `affected tests (linux, advisory)`) can fail from a real regression. The required/non-required distinction is about merge-blocking, not about how the failure is classified. If a deterministic build error (`error[E...]`, "binary not found", "ambiguous candidates", missing target) repeats across consecutive runs of the same shape, it's a real regression even when the job is advisory. Reserve "transient" for non-deterministic causes: `BrokenPipe`, `connection reset`, runner disk full, GitHub API timeouts, host-availability blips.

**Lychee link-check timeouts are always transient** unless the same URL has
failed on at least two separate runs within the last few days. The check runs
as the `link-check` job in the `nightly` workflow. `.config/lychee.toml`
already sets `max_retries = 6` and lists known-unreliable hosts; one timeout
is not enough evidence to extend that list. Signals you have a transient
failure, not a broken link:

- The previous run on the same or a nearby commit passed.
- Only `[TIMEOUT]` is reported (not `404`/`403`/`410`).
- The URL is reachable from a local `curl`.

When in doubt, post a comment on the failed run summarizing the diagnosis and
wait — don't open a PR.

## Applying GitHub Suggestions

Apply the literal suggestion only — change the lines it covers, nothing more.
If surrounding lines also need updating, note that in your reply.

## PR Review: Don't Self-Dismiss Over Unrelated Test Flakes

If a clearly-unrelated test fails after you've already approved a PR, leave
the approval in place and post a comment noting the flake. Do **not** dismiss
your own approval to "gate" on a rerun.

GitHub blocks both `gh run rerun --failed` and per-job rerun
(`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/jobs/{id}/rerun`) with HTTP 403 while
*any* job in the same workflow run is still `in_progress`. The non-required
`benchmarks` job routinely runs 80+ minutes after `test (linux|macos|windows)`
finish, so dismiss-then-wait-then-rerun cascades into a long session for no
benefit — the maintainer can rerun the failed job directly once `benchmarks`
clears, or merge regardless if the failure is clearly a flake.

The codecov-failure dismissal pattern is different and remains correct:
`AGENTS.md` requires explicit user approval before merging with failing
`codecov/patch`, so dismissing the approval until the coverage gap is
addressed is intentional.

## Weigh the root-cause fix before shipping a workaround

When a mismatch, a false positive, or a stale value has an obvious non-code
workaround (a template change, a config value, an alias, a comment recording
the drift), don't stop there. First check whether the workaround is **lossy or
foot-gunny**, and weigh a proportionate **root-cause code fix** before opening
a PR that only records it. A "docs-only, no risk" framing is not the same as
good guidance — a zero-code-risk change can still steer users toward a
collision-prone or lossy config, and annotating a stale value leaves the
duplication that made it stale. If you do recommend a workaround, surface its
downsides in the PR body up front, not only when challenged.

This governs every workflow that opens a PR here, not just issue triage.

## Issue Triage

When you need more information to diagnose a reported bug, the **primary
ask is `wt -vv <command>`**. Re-running the failing command with `-vv`
writes a diagnostic bundle — a single report containing wt/git/OS versions,
shell integration, `wt config show`, `git worktree list --porcelain`, and a
`trace.log` of every git invocation with its output. The `-vv` output prints
the bundle's exact absolute path (`Diagnostics and performance profile
saved @ …`) followed by a ready-to-run `gh gist create --web
<path>` line — **point the user at those printed lines; don't hand them a
hardcoded path**. In particular, never tell them to `cat
.git/wt/logs/diagnostic.md`: inside a linked worktree `.git` is a gitdir
*file*, not a directory, so that path fails with `Not a directory (os error
20)` (`ENOTDIR`). The bundle actually lives under the git *common* dir —
`"$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/wt/logs/diagnostic.md"` resolves from any
worktree, and the printed absolute path already points there. One gist URL
pasted into the issue gives us most of what we'd otherwise ask for piecemeal,
so lead with this for unexplained failures rather than chaining
version/config/repro questions across multiple round-trips.

When the report is about a slow `wt` command, read its **Performance profile**
section first. It renders the same breakdown as `wt config state logs profile`
(subprocess time by command type, slowest calls, repeated `(command, context)`
pairs) directly from the bundled `trace.log`, so you can spot redundant git
calls and slow commands without parsing the raw trace by hand. The same
report run against a statusline capture is the weekly per-render cache
check — see **Weekly Maintenance: Statusline Cache-Check**.

Reach for narrower asks only when the diagnostic is overkill:

- `wt --version` — when the only question is whether a fix has landed.
- `wt config show` — when the suspicion is purely config/shell-integration
  and you already have the command + repro.

### Don't ship fixes you can't verify

When the bug or proposed fix turns on runtime state the bot can't observe from CI — plugin hooks firing inside an agent CLI (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini), shell-integration side effects, interactive prompt rendering, signal forwarding into a TTY — do **not** open a PR premised on the hypothesis. Signals to stop:

- The proposed transition fires inside a running agent session the bot can't drive from a test (`PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `Notification`, statusline redraws).
- The "analysis" in the issue is an LLM-written trace pasted by the reporter, not a verified observation. Treat that as a starting hypothesis, not ground truth — a Claude-written explanation of why X is broken is no more trustworthy than the bot's own first guess.
- The repro requires an interactive shell or `claude` running in a tmux that the bot can't spin up.

Comment on the issue with what's known, ask the reporter for the concrete symptom they observe ("which marker shows where, when") rather than for a fix to validate, and exit without a PR. The bar for opening a fix PR is *the failure mode is reproducible and the fix is testable*, not *the hypothesis seems plausible*. If you post a fix despite limited testability (rare — usually only when the reporter has confirmed the exact symptom and the code change is obviously correct from inspection), explicitly flag what wasn't verified in the PR body.

### Closing Duplicates

When an issue is clearly a duplicate, close it after commenting. Use
`gh issue close <number>` and tell the reporter: if they believe this was
closed in error, they can let us know and we'll reopen it.

### Check `--config-set` before calling a setting unpinnable

`wt --config-set '<toml>'` overrides any user config key for one invocation,
above both config files and `WORKTRUNK_SECTION__KEY` env vars ([inline config
overrides](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#inline-config-overrides-config-set)).
The resolver just reads `repo.config().<key>` and shows no sign of that layer,
so before writing "there's no way to do X per invocation", ask whether X is a
config key: the ask is usually already met, and the reply is a `--config-set`
recipe plus a docs fix where the docs don't connect the flag to the setting.
Pinning is all that covers — weigh the request's residual asks on their own
merits.

### Suggesting Aliases for Niche Feature Requests

worktrunk deliberately limits flag and config growth, so a `wt` alias is the
standing answer to a narrow feature request rather than a new native flag.
Suggest one when the request serves a single reporter's workflow or a small
subset of users (idempotent create-or-switch, auto-push after merge) and
composes from existing `wt` commands.

Answer with a `wt` `[aliases]` entry. Defined in user config, it resolves
`wt <name>` to the alias whenever no built-in matches, so the same alias works
across every repo. It's the project's preferred extension point.

**How to respond:**
1. Search open and closed issues for the same request and link the prior
   thread; these asks recur, and the link lets the deflection read as a
   considered position rather than a brush-off.
2. Draft the alias.
3. Test it in a scratch worktree against the happy path and edge cases (branch
   already exists, dirty worktree). When a surprising behavior turns up, note
   it in the reply instead of building the alias around it. For example, a
   create-or-switch wrapper inherits `wt switch <name>`'s habit of
   materializing a *remote* branch of the same name.
4. Post the tested alias with usage examples.
5. Link to the [aliases docs](https://worktrunk.dev/extending/#aliases) and
   [tips & patterns](https://worktrunk.dev/tips-patterns/).

## Weekly Maintenance: MSRV & Toolchain

Bump both MSRV and the development toolchain to **latest stable − 1**. When
Rust 1.N is the current stable release, set both to 1.(N−1).

Files to update:

| File | Field | Example (if stable is 1.94) |
|------|-------|----|
| `Cargo.toml` | `rust-version` | `"1.93"` |
| `tests/helpers/wt-perf/Cargo.toml` | `rust-version` | `"1.93"` |
| `rust-toolchain.toml` | `channel` | `"1.93.0"` |
| `.github/workflows/nightly.yaml` | `rustup override set nightly-<date>`, twice (`minimal-versions`, `check-unused-dependencies`) | a nightly from the last few weeks |

Bump the nightly pins only when the pinned date is more than three months old.
Cargo refuses a workspace whose `rust-version` exceeds the toolchain, so an
MSRV bump past a stale pin fails both jobs before they check anything.

`flake.nix` reads the channel from `rust-toolchain.toml`, so no separate bump
is needed. After updating the toolchain, refresh `flake.lock` so the locked
`rust-overlay` revision knows about the new version. `tend-setup` installs Nix
with flakes enabled:

```bash
# Name the input: a bare `nix flake update` also relocks nixpkgs, an
# unrelated bump in a toolchain-scoped PR.
nix flake update rust-overlay
# Check the bumped channel still evaluates
nix eval .#devShells.x86_64-linux.default.name
```

Commit `flake.lock` alongside the other toolchain changes once both commands
succeed. A failure is reported in the PR, never worked around: leave the file
alone if the update fails, `git checkout flake.lock` if the eval does, and
hand-compute an entry in neither case.

**Expect both commands to fail from tend 0.2.5 on, with `cannot create Unix
domain socket: Address family not supported by protocol`.** `nix` resolves on
the agent's PATH, but the multi-user client reaches the store by connecting to
`/nix/var/nix/daemon-socket/socket`, and the sandbox blocks
`socket(AF_UNIX, …)` outright — still true under 0.2.14's systemd unit. That
is the reported failure above, not a problem with the bump: say so in the PR,
leave `flake.lock` untouched, and carry the rest of the toolchain change as
normal. It clears when max-sixty/tend#1197 gives the action a lever for it.

After bumping, run the full test suite (`cargo run -- hook pre-merge --yes`)
and verify `cargo msrv verify` passes.

## Weekly Maintenance: CI Pin Bumps

Pinned third-party versions in CI are invisible to Dependabot — it follows `Cargo.toml` deps and `uses: foo@vN` action refs, not inline `version:` strings. They drift unless this step bumps them.

Each weekly run checks every pin below against upstream and bumps whatever has drifted. A bump that can turn a whole CI leg red — an OS image, a major version, a tool whose version moves snapshots — goes on its own branch and PR, so a red matrix decides only that bump instead of holding back the week's safe ones. The weekly runner is Linux, so that PR's own checks are the only place a macOS or Windows change gets tested; open it and report what they said.

- **`baptiste0928/cargo-install@v3` blocks** in `.github/workflows/{affected,ci,coverage,nightly}.yaml` and `.github/actions/{test,tend}-setup/action.yaml` — every `version: "=X.Y.Z"` against `cargo info <crate>`. Today: `cargo-affected`, `cargo-insta`, `cargo-nextest`, `cargo-llvm-cov`, `cargo-msrv`, `cargo-udeps`, `lychee`, `worktrunk`. `cargo-affected` is pinned twice in `affected.yaml`; move both together. Verify each crate's `rust-version` against the pinned toolchain and note compatibility in the PR body (see PR #1657 for the format).
- **`hustcer/setup-nu@v3`** `version:` input — latest from `gh api repos/nushell/nushell/releases/latest --jq '.tag_name'`. Five call sites: `coverage.yaml` (`code-coverage`), `nightly.yaml` (`feature-powerset`), `benchmarks.yaml` (`benchmarks`), and `.github/actions/{test,tend}-setup/action.yaml` — `tend-setup`'s copy is what puts `nu` in the agent's sandbox, so it moves with the others.
- **Codex Cloud tools** — `.codex/cloud.sh` pins pre-commit, cargo-insta, cargo-nextest, Nushell, and PowerShell; `setup-web` pins Nushell and PowerShell. Keep cargo-insta, cargo-nextest, and Nushell level with `.github/actions/test-setup/action.yaml`, which pins the same three — the gate runs `--all-features`, so Nushell's version moves PTY snapshots. Nothing under `.github/` pins PowerShell (CI runs whatever the runner image ships), so bump that one on its own.
- **Docs site packages** in `docs/package.json` are covered by Dependabot's `/docs` npm entry. Do not duplicate those bumps in this manual pin pass. The one thing that pass does own is the `ignore` entry for `typescript` majors in `.github/dependabot.yaml`: it suppresses the proposal Dependabot would otherwise make, so nothing else can surface it. Check `npm view @astrojs/check peerDependencies.typescript` against the current `typescript` major and delete the entry once the range covers it — the rule is version-agnostic, so left in place it blocks a major `@astrojs/check` fully supports just as silently as the TypeScript 7 it was added for (#3877).
- **Runner images** — every `runs-on:` label and matrix `os:`/`runner:` value in the workflows. A pin equals what its `-latest` label currently resolves to, per the availability table in `actions/runner-images`:

  ```bash
  gh api repos/actions/runner-images/contents/README.md \
    -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw' | sed -n '/^| Image/,/^$/p'
  ```

  Bump any pin the table no longer lists against `-latest`, and update `ci.yaml`'s header comment, which records the reason for each image it names. GitHub keeps two GA images per OS and begins deprecating the older one as soon as a newer goes GA, so a pin that has fallen off `-latest` is already the next one due; the table's `deprecated` badge marks that deadline, not the moment to move, and a row badged `preview` is not a bump target.

  A variant label — `-arm`, `-intel`, `-large` — has no `-latest` of its own; it follows its base image's row.

  Where a pin is deliberately held back, that comment says what the repo needs from the older image. Re-check that need against the newer image each week — upstream announces image changes as issues, so `gh search issues --repo actions/runner-images "<the need> <newer image>"` surfaces a reversal. Reading the cited issue's state is not the test — an announcement closes when its change ships, in either direction.

  The `tend-*.yaml` workflows also pin a runner, but tend's generator writes them and `uvx tend@latest init` overwrites a hand edit; file a tend issue for those.

Discovery shortcut: a recent green CI run on `main` flags cargo-install drift directly via workflow annotations. `gh run view <run-id> --json jobs --jq '.jobs[].databaseId' | xargs -I{} gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/check-runs/{}/annotations` returns one warning per outdated pin.

## Weekly Maintenance: Statusline Cache-Check

Detect new in-process cache-miss duplicates introduced by recent changes by
profiling a real `wt list statusline --format=claude-code` trace. The render
runs on every Claude Code prompt redraw, so duplicate git subprocesses there
compound into measurable fseventsd / IPC load.

```bash
# Run from any worktree of this repo. `jq -n` builds the stdin JSON so the
# recipe is portable (the weekly job runs on ubuntu-24.04, whose GNU sed
# rejects BSD's `sed -i ''`) and so a path with a quote can't corrupt it.
jq -n --arg cwd "$PWD" '{
  hook_event_name: "Status",
  workspace: {current_dir: $cwd},
  model: {display_name: "Opus"},
  context_window: {used_percentage: 42.0}
}' > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/statusline-input.json"

# Debug build on purpose. `tend-weekly` installs no `wt` and restores no Rust
# cache, so `--release` means a cold optimized build of the whole dependency
# graph before the first render. The duplicate `(command, context)` pairs this
# check reads are profile-independent; only the timing columns, which this
# section doesn't triage, would be worth a release build.
cargo run -- -vv list statusline --format=claude-code \
  < "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/statusline-input.json" > /dev/null
cargo run -- config state logs profile --format=json | jq .cache
```

The `.cache` report flags commands invoked more than once with the same context.
Triage each duplicate:

- **Legitimate** (different cwd, different ref form that can't be normalized,
  intentional double-call across phases) — note in the response and move on.
- **Cache miss** (same logical operation should hit cache but doesn't) —
  open an issue or fix it. Common shapes: `merge_base("main", "<sha>")` vs
  `merge_base("main", "branch")` keying separately;
  `worktree_at(cwd)` vs `worktree_at(porcelain_path)` not canonicalizing.

## Weekly Maintenance: LLM Model Names in Docs

Grep for current Claude and Codex pins across every tracked file:

```bash
git grep -niE "claude|codex"
```

Check the latest IDs at <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models> and <https://developers.openai.com/codex/models>. The recommended commit-message commands should use the most recent fastest model from each vendor (Haiku for Anthropic, the smallest current Codex variant for OpenAI).

**On drift, open a PR — don't file an issue.** The source of truth is `after_long_help` in `src/cli/mod.rs`; edit it and let `cargo test --test integration test_docs_are_in_sync` regenerate the mirrors under `docs/src/content/docs/` and `skills/worktrunk/reference/`. The "smallest current variant" call is a judgment — pick the one the vendor's models page currently positions as fastest/smallest, and explain the choice in the PR body. Verifying the new model name with an installed CLI (`codex -m <name>`, etc.) isn't possible in this CI sandbox; the PR is the right output anyway, and the maintainer tests on merge.

## Weekly Maintenance: Agent App Integration Surfaces

Worktrunk ships a plugin for each agent CLI it integrates with, and those CLIs
change their integration surfaces without notice. Each week, scan the upstream
changelogs and flag changes that affect what Worktrunk consumes or produces.

| App | Source to check | Integration surface |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------|
| Claude Code | `gh api repos/anthropics/claude-code/contents/CHANGELOG.md -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw'`, plus `curl -sL https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline.md` for the statusline JSON schema | statusline stdin JSON, `WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove` hooks, plugin marketplace, `/wt-switch-create` |
| Codex | `gh release list -R openai/codex -L 10` | plugin marketplace |
| Gemini CLI | `gh release list -R google-gemini/gemini-cli -L 10` | native extension loading |
| OpenCode | `gh release list -R sst/opencode -L 10` | plugins API in `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` |

What to flag:

- **New statusline JSON fields** — `src/commands/statusline.rs` parses `workspace.current_dir`, `model.display_name`, `context_window.used_percentage`, and `rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.{used_percentage,resets_at}`. A newly added field (session cost, PR review state) may be worth surfacing in `wt list statusline`.
- **Renamed or removed hook events** — `WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove` route agent worktree creation through `wt`; a renamed event silently disables isolation rather than erroring.
- **Changed plugin install mechanisms** — `wt config plugins {claude,codex,opencode} install` and the Gemini extension manifest break if the marketplace or plugins-directory contract changes.

Don't open a PR speculatively. File one issue per relevant change, linking the upstream entry and noting what Worktrunk would need to do. If nothing changed, say so and move on.

## README Date Check

The README blockquote opens with a month+year (e.g., "**April 2026**"). During daily
maintenance, verify the month matches the current month and update it if stale.

## Per-Workflow References

- **PR review**: `@references/review-pr.md` — Rust idioms, documentation accuracy, duplication search
- **Nightly sweep**: `@references/nightly-cleaner.md` — survey checklist, branch naming, CI-breakage ownership
