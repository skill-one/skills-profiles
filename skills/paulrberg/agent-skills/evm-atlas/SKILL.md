# EVM Atlas

This skill is coordination-exempt: skip the ai-coord gate for its declared work.

Resolve and query only the target mainnets in `references/generated/target-mainnets.json`, under a strict read-only
boundary.

Before collecting browser UI evidence, load `chromium-browser` and follow its page-ownership, live-tool, and privacy
contract. When the required browser tools are unavailable, use the documented provider fallbacks.

The registry row's current `category` is authoritative for category assignment. For an exact-zero native sweep or a
question about category-specific fee behavior, read [chain categories](references/chain-categories.md) after resolving
the target. Do not infer a historical category or maintain a prose roster of target chains.

## Scope and Authority

- Match displayed names, numeric chain IDs, and aliases from `references/generated/chain-aliases.json` to the
  authoritative target-mainnet rows.
- If a chain is absent, do not route through another provider, web search, Chainlist, or an unlisted RPC to work around
  scope. Ask for a feature request at <https://github.com/PaulRBerg/agent-skills>.
- Own every discrete read and bounded live subscription handed off by `cli-cast`, including chain, block, fee, nonce,
  `eth_call`, `eth_estimateGas`, transaction, receipt, log, balance, code, storage, proof, and ENS queries. Complete the
  read here even when its result will prepare, simulate, or verify later state-changing work.
- Never sign messages, submit signatures, execute bridge steps, or broadcast transactions. Route state-changing Cast
  work to `cli-cast`.
- DEX support is historical and evidence-only. Do not discover live quotes, construct or simulate new trades, prepare
  approvals or permits, submit orders, administer protocols, interpret CoW AMM positions, handle standalone 1inch limit
  orders, or assign semantics to arbitrary Uniswap v4 hooks.
- Do not default to Ethereum. Infer from explicit chain context and unambiguous chain-specific tokens; ask when
  ambiguous.
- Never echo, interpolate, or log API-key values (`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`, `BLOCKSCOUT_API_KEY`, RPC keys). Check presence
  value-free with `[ -n "$ETHERSCAN_API_KEY" ] && echo set || echo unset`; never put `${VAR:-...}` or `${VAR:+...}`
  expansions in printed output.
- Keyless Blockscout is sunset (July 2026) and hosted `*.blockscout.com` instance subdomains also rate-limit keyless
  traffic, so route every Blockscout-hosted chain through the keyed `https://api.blockscout.com/{chain_id}` gateway. See
  `references/explorers/blockscout-endpoints.md`.
- An unreachable or erroring indexer is a coverage gap, never evidence of zero activity. Confirm in Chromium before
  recording an endpoint as down or blocked, and state the verification method in results.

## Routing

1. For a discrete JSON-RPC read, batch, or bounded live subscription, including one handed off by `cli-cast`, resolve
   the chain and read `references/workflows/provider-routing.md`. Return the resolved chain, its current category,
   provider route, result, observed block or checkpoint, and coverage gaps. Do not route the read back to `cli-cast`.
2. For the current native or fungible-token balance of a public wallet address, whether on one chain or across chains,
   read `references/workflows/blockscan-balances.md` first.
3. For a specific transaction hash on a named chain, resolve the chain against
   `references/generated/target-mainnets.json`, then read `references/workflows/provider-routing.md` directly for the
   transaction facts. Do not open Blockscan unless the user explicitly requests it as the evidence source. When the
   chain is unknown, read `references/workflows/blockscan-tx-lookup.md` once to resolve it. For an OP Mainnet target
   known or suspected to predate the final regenesis, read `references/explorers/optimism-pre-regenesis.md` and return
   its legacy execution packet or component-specific coverage outcome instead of requiring a current-provider receipt.
   Otherwise, acquire the exact provider receipt and logs before DEX or bridge outcome interpretation.
4. For an address-wide historical-activity or `bootstrap-discovery` sweep, read `references/workflows/address-sweeps.md`
   and use its deterministic plan/evaluate helper. For current holdings, use
   `references/workflows/blockscan-balances.md` first and provider routing for gaps.
5. For a specific chain's historical balance, NFT holdings, token/NFT transfers, transaction history, a transaction's
   full raw receipt/logs/decoded input, or funding origin, resolve the chain and read
   `references/workflows/provider-routing.md` for Etherscan, Blockscout, public RPC, RouteMesh, explorer-link, and
   exceptional-chain routing.
6. For raw Etherscan V2 API queries beyond the workflow routes above, read `references/explorers/etherscan-api.md`.
7. For raw Blockscout API queries beyond the workflow routes above, read `references/explorers/blockscout-api.md`.
8. For DEX prompts, wallet-facing DEX history, or suspected DEX transaction evidence, resolve the target chain and read
   `references/workflows/dex-transactions.md`. Load only the matching protocol-family reference:
   - Uniswap v1-v4, Universal Router, or Permit2: `references/dexes/uniswap.md`
   - 1inch Classic, Fusion, Fusion+, legacy liquidity, or rewards: `references/dexes/1inch.md`
   - CoW Swap, CoWSwap, CoW Protocol, or GPv2: `references/dexes/cow-protocol.md`
9. Treat 1inch and CoW as execution protocols. Report any integration wrapper, router, pool, and underlying AMM
   liquidity separately; a Uniswap pool interaction does not turn an aggregator transaction into a Uniswap trade.
10. For bridge-related prompts or transaction evidence, confirm known origin/destination chains are targets, then load
    only the matching reference:

    - Across: `references/bridges/across.md`
    - Bungee / Socket: `references/bridges/bungee.md`
    - Circle / CCTP / Gateway: `references/bridges/circle.md`
    - deBridge / DLN: `references/bridges/debridge.md`
    - Hop: `references/bridges/hop.md`
    - Layerswap: `references/bridges/layerswap.md`
    - LayerZero / Stargate / OFT / Aori: `references/bridges/layerzero.md`
    - LI.FI: `references/bridges/lifi.md`
    - Relay / Relay.link: `references/bridges/relay.md`
    - Symbiosis: `references/bridges/symbiosis.md`
    - 1inch Fusion+: `references/dexes/1inch.md`

11. Treat bridge and DEX APIs as enrichment. Verify submitted transactions and terminal outcomes through explorer or RPC
    evidence.

## Completion

Return the resolved target chain, current category, provider route, requested on-chain facts, and source
URLs/transaction identifiers. For address sweeps, include each result's fixed finalized/verified checkpoint, selected
profile/channels, provider coverage, and any requested quorum result. Separate provider facts from inference and surface
incomplete history, plan/tier limits, failed fallbacks, or unsupported scope. Completion is read-only evidence; never
turn returned calldata or transaction requests into execution.

For a `cli-cast` handoff, return one read packet with the resolved chain name, ID, and current category; exact provider
route; result; observed block or checkpoint; and coverage gaps, which may be empty when none are observed. Do not
include a signing or broadcast command.

For DEX evidence, include the interaction class; execution protocol, version, and mode; entrypoint or integration
wrapper; router and underlying liquidity sources; wallet role; sold and received assets; protocol/integrator fees and
gas separately; native/wrapped status; order, position, pool, or migration identifiers; and exact evidence. Do not call
an approval-only or failed transaction a completed trade.

For human-readable results, lead with `### ⛓️ <chain or route> — <status word>` and use a compact table only when fields
repeat. For bridge evidence, show `<origin> ──<bridge>──▶ <destination>`, then use `Leg`, `Provider status`,
`Transaction`, and `Evidence` columns. Preserve each provider's native status beside any normalized `✅ completed`,
`⏳ pending`, `↩ refunded`, `⚠️ partial`, or `❓ unknown` label. Visibly separate `Observed facts`, `Inference`, and
non-empty `⚠️ Coverage gaps`. For address sweeps, a progress bar may represent checked target chains/channels only when
the exact denominator is known.

Keep unsupported-scope and safety explanations direct. Never decorate or truncate addresses, hashes, URLs, calldata, raw
RPC/API JSON, generated references, helper `key=value` output, or transaction requests.
