# Copy Transcript Path

Copy the active chat's transcript path to the clipboard.

This skill is coordination-exempt: skip the ai-coord gate for its declared work.

## Supported Chat Hosts

Before doing any work, identify the current chat host. If it is not Claude Code or Codex CLI, stop with this error:
`This skill only works in Claude Code or Codex CLI.`

## Workflow

Resolve `scripts/copy-transcript-path.sh` relative to this `SKILL.md` and run it with no arguments:

```sh
bash <skill-dir>/scripts/copy-transcript-path.sh
```

Return the helper's successful stdout verbatim and stop. Do not infer a transcript from the current project, select a
recent session, or add explanation.

Successful completion requires the helper to exit 0 and its stdout to be returned verbatim. Report a helper failure as
the outcome; it does not count as completion.
