# Repo Rename

If these instructions are already present in the conversation from a slash or dollar invocation, follow them directly;
do not invoke this skill again through a skill tool.

Preview the complete GitHub, Git, filesystem, and agent-continuity mutation set before applying a repository rename.

## Scope

- Rename the current GitHub repository, matching local folder, and `origin` URL.
- Update literal old paths in `~/.claude/projects`, `~/claude/projects` when present, `~/.codex/sessions`, and
  `~/.codex/config.toml` only when the repository has an active Claude Code or Codex transcript; this continuity update
  does not apply to repos with no active transcripts.
- Update constrained literal old-name references inside the repository, excluding VCS, dependencies (including Python
  virtual environments), caches, and generated build directories.
- By default, skip `PROMPT.md`, `TODO.md`, and symlinks before reading replacement candidates; prune excluded
  directories during discovery. When the user explicitly authorizes updating notes, dependencies, caches, or generated
  files, pass `--include-local-state` to both preview and apply. This includes those repository text files while
  preserving file permissions; symlinks, binary files, and `.git` remain excluded.
- The helper honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CODEX_HOME`, gates continuity updates on active transcripts, and replaces
  only the absolute repository path in continuity stores and Codex config.
- Do not modify other transcript stores, archives, remotes, or repositories.

## Workflow

1. Check whether the repository has any active AI chat transcript before treating continuity preservation as in scope:
   - Claude Code: resolve `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/projects/<encoded-repo-path>` (the absolute repo path with
     every non-alphanumeric character replaced by `-`) and check it exists and is non-empty.
   - Codex: resolve `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/sessions` and check whether any session file references the exact absolute
     repo path.
   - If neither exists, state that the transcript-continuity update does not apply; the rename may still proceed for the
     GitHub, git, filesystem, and repository-content changes below.

2. Resolve the skill directory and run the helper from the repository to produce a read-only preview:

   ```sh
   uv run <skill-dir>/scripts/repo-rename.py <new-name> --dry-run
   ```

   The helper requires a clean worktree, matching GitHub repo/folder names, a free target path, and valid GitHub
   context. It prints the old/new repo and paths, exact confirmation token, external commands, directory moves, every
   replacement file, occurrence counts, and rollback coverage.

3. If `--dry-run` was requested, return the preview and stop. A successful dry run must not change the GitHub repo,
   remote, folder, config, transcripts, or repository files.

4. Otherwise present the complete preview and require explicit confirmation in a subsequent user message. Explain that
   the confirmation authorizes the GitHub rename, local folder move, Claude project-folder move when enabled, origin
   update, and every listed continuity/repository replacement. Lead with `### ⚠️ Rename preview — no changes made`; show
   GitHub, folder, origin, replacement counts, and rollback coverage in compact tables, then the exhaustive file/count
   list. Put the exact confirmation token alone in code formatting. If any preview fact changes, regenerate it and ask
   again.

5. After confirmation, pass the preview's exact token:

   ```sh
   uv run <skill-dir>/scripts/repo-rename.py <new-name> --apply --confirm '<owner/old->owner/new>'
   ```

   The helper re-runs preflight, backs up every replacement file, applies deterministic literal replacements, and
   attempts rollback on failure. Never bypass its clean-tree, target-path, or confirmation checks.

6. Verify the helper's result with `gh repo view`, `git remote get-url origin`, `pwd -P`, and a search for remaining old
   absolute-path/name references in the listed scope. Report intentional remaining matches separately.

## Completion

Dry-run completion is a full mutation preview with zero writes. Apply completion requires the new GitHub identity,
folder, remote, and listed continuity references to agree, plus a clean verification report. If rollback is incomplete,
stop and lead with `### ⛔ Rollback incomplete`, then report every failed rollback action before doing anything else. On
success, use `### ✅ Repository renamed` and a surface/expected/verified table. Keep helper JSON, confirmation tokens,
commands, paths, URLs, and rollback errors exact and undecorated.
