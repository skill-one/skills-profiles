# HTML Debrief

Persist current-task evidence as an interactive HTML report.

Default to a standard desktop-browser layout. Do not implement or inspect responsive/mobile behavior unless the user
asks.

## Output and Authority

- Output: `./.ai/debriefs/<slug>/index.html` using the installed `html-playground` skill.
- Derive a short topical kebab-case slug when omitted.
- Write only inside the selected debrief directory. If an inferred slug already exists, choose a collision-free semantic
  qualifier, falling back to a timestamp suffix, and continue without overwriting. If the user explicitly supplied the
  slug, stop and ask whether to overwrite or choose a new slug.
- Use only evidence present in the current task: real findings, paths, verified locations, metrics, decisions, and
  unresolved risks. Do not invent filler.

## Workflow

1. Run the bundled preparer from the target repository:

   ```sh
   bash <skill-dir>/scripts/prepare.sh <slug>
   ```

   Use its `PLAYGROUND_DIR`, `DEBRIEFS_DIR`, `DEBRIEF_PATH`, and `EXISTS` output. When `EXISTS` is true for an inferred
   slug, derive a unique slug and rerun the preparer before writing. When it is true for an explicit slug, request the
   choice defined above. Relay dependency or slug-validation errors and stop.

2. Read the resolved HTML playground `SKILL.md` and exactly one matching template: diff review, document critique, code
   map, concept map, data explorer, or design playground. Adapt its interaction model to the evidence; do not load every
   template.

3. Build one self-contained HTML file with the playground's live controls, useful presets, evidence view,
   natural-language prompt output, and copy feedback. Use no external dependencies.

4. Verify that every claim traces to the task transcript or tool evidence, the output contains no placeholders, and the
   file renders in a desktop browser. Then run `open "$DEBRIEF_PATH"` and finish with `### 📊 Debrief ready — <title>`,
   the clickable absolute path, `Opened in desktop browser`, and one compact line naming the evidence view and presets.

Completion requires a non-placeholder HTML debrief at the selected path, evidence-grounded content, successful
rendered/file inspection, and collision handling that never silently overwrites. Keep preparer `KEY=VALUE` output,
dependency commands, paths, and slug errors exact and undecorated.
