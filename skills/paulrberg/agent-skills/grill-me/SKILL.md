  Interview the user relentlessly about a plan or design until every branch of the decision tree has an explicit
  recorded decision and no open questions remain. Use when user wants to stress-test a plan, get grilled on their
  design, or mentions "grill me".

# Grill Me

This skill is coordination-exempt: skip the ai-coord gate for its declared work.

Stress-test the plan one decision at a time until every material branch is resolved.

## Workflow

1. Extract the current objective, constraints, assumptions, and already-made decisions. Investigate any answer
   discoverable from the codebase or supplied evidence instead of asking the user.
2. Maintain a running decision record with: decision, chosen option, rationale, dependencies, and consequences. Update
   it after every answer; do not reopen a recorded decision unless new evidence conflicts with it.
3. Ask exactly one question at a time. Format the turn as `### 🔥 Decision <N> — <topic>`, then `Recommended`, `Why`,
   `Tradeoff`, and `Question`. Choose the highest-leverage unresolved branch whose answer constrains the most downstream
   decisions. After each answer, acknowledge `✅ Recorded: <choice> — <consequence>` before the next card. Show settled
   and currently open counts when useful; never show a percentage because the decision tree can grow.
4. Continue through scope, users, interfaces, data/state, failure modes, security, operations, migration, testing,
   rollout, ownership, and stopping criteria only where they are material to this design.
5. When no material open branches remain, return `### ✅ Decision record` with a decision/choice/rationale/consequence
   table, then `### ⚠️ Risks`, accepted unknowns with owner/resolution point, rejected alternatives that matter, and
   `### 🏁 Completion criteria`. Do not end with another question.

Completion requires every material branch to have a recorded decision or an explicitly accepted unknown with an owner
and resolution point.
