# Claude Handoff

Orchestrates read-only investigation or implementation within the current session after explicit plan approval.
Task-handoff instead writes a decision-complete file for a fresh, separate session — use it for work continuing later or
elsewhere; use an in-session handoff to implement an approved plan now.

If these instructions are already present from a slash or dollar invocation, follow them directly; do not invoke this
skill again through a skill tool.

Follow the Contract, then use Claude Code's in-session Agent workflow to research during planning and implement the
approved plan.

## Contract

- Run only after explicit user invocation. Classify a task research-only when its requested outcome is findings,
  evidence, or an assessment, with no repository changes or implementation plan requested. All handoffs may run in any
  host mode; implementation handoffs must pass through the Plan Phase and receive explicit user approval before launch.
- Claude owns decisions, the final plan, and orchestration. Delegate investigation to read-only research subagents only
  when task and repository evidence make it useful before planning.
- Research agents gather evidence and report findings; never edit files, decide design, or return plans.
- Implementation agents implement their assigned part of the approved plan — inspect, edit, validate — never redesign or
  return another plan.
- Use the smallest effective team (one agent is valid); add agents only when decomposition materially improves latency,
  correctness, or verification. Never exceed eight implementation agents per handoff.
- Size every brief before finalizing the team: estimate wall-clock time and split anything likely to exceed roughly
  25-30 minutes into parallel disjoint scopes or dependency waves, adding an integration agent as needed.
- Use at most three research agents, stable IDs `R1`-`R3`, counted separately from the eight implementation agents.
- Keep Claude's own work to orchestration, integrity checks, failure handling, and conditional polish passes.
- Let Claude Code choose foreground or background delivery. Only a direct terminal result or error, or a later
  completion or failure notification, settles an agent — a launch acknowledgement, native task row, quiet period, or
  surfaced permission prompt does not. Reconcile a wave only after every required terminal outcome arrives.
- Treat an explicit user model preference (e.g. Sonnet, Opus) as an orchestration constraint on every research and
  implementation agent unless scoped narrower — never substitute the usual Sonnet/Opus selection. If the Agent tool
  cannot launch that model, report the incompatibility and ask before falling back.
- Treat the approved outcome, not the initial manifest or its write scopes, as the authorization boundary: when
  implementation reveals a related in-repository fix or evidence change the outcome requires, Claude may extend the
  handoff and launch follow-on agents without asking again. The discovering subagent still stops at its assigned scope
  and returns evidence; Claude owns scope expansion, coordination, and delegation.
- Size verification to the requested outcome. Never add validation machinery (gates, manifests, checkpoints, hash pins,
  journals, receipts) unless the approved plan explicitly calls for it. An explicit user request to hurry or wrap up
  overrides optional repeat checks and required polish passes: commit the validated work and report what was skipped or
  left unverified.

Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the task when present; otherwise the active user request. A task naming another skill follows
Companion Skills.

## Companion Skills

A task that names another skill alongside this handoff — for example,
`run $fresh-eyes-sweep and delegate the implementation` — is a composition: the companion skill defines the work; this
handoff owns delegation mechanics.

- Load the companion skill and run its discovery, judgment, and planning phases in Claude. Route read-only discovery
  through this skill's research agents when materially faster, then fold the companion's method, findings, and
  constraints into the handoff plan. A companion missing from the skill list may be installed but hidden by
  `disable-model-invocation: true`: read `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directly before concluding it is absent.
- When the companion's discovery is itself the bulk of the work — an audit or sweep over a whole repository or large
  file set — Claude maps the scope and slices it instead of reading it inline. After plan approval, each implementation
  agent audits and fixes its own slice under the companion's rules, inlined in its brief.
- This contract overrides the companion's overlapping plan approval, agent limits and stable IDs, single validation
  owner, result fields, failure classification, commit ownership, and completion reporting, even when the companion
  prescribes its own subagent, validation, or commit mechanics. Its user-decision gates still bind; this skill's plan
  approval satisfies coincident gates, and a plan-only companion implements only when the combined invocation requested
  implementation and the user approved the plan.
- Agents cannot load skills. Never brief one to "use skill X" by name; inline the specific companion instructions,
  conventions, or excerpts it needs.
- A companion requirement to run `$code-polish` or `$agents-brain polish` marks that pass required in the Plan Phase; it
  still runs once, per Completion. Companion commit instructions never add commits.
- Satisfy both contracts at Completion: produce the companion's required report artifacts (ledgers, tables, verdicts)
  alongside the completion report.

## Research Phase

For a research-only task, launch one to three research agents and stop after returning the consolidated investigation;
never enter the Plan Phase or launch implementation agents. For an implementation handoff, trigger research when scope
is uncertain, the task crosses multiple or unfamiliar subsystems, or serial evidence-gathering would be materially
slower. Zero research agents is the default for implementation handoffs. Claude alone decides the count from task and
repository evidence; never ask the user to opt in or name agents.

When triggered, assign up to three agents stable IDs `R1`-`R3` and launch immediately via the Agent tool with
`subagent_type: "Explore"` and an explicit model, unless the user stated a model preference: `sonnet` for bounded
surveys, `opus` for involved sweeps across unfamiliar or multiple subsystems. Omitting `model` inherits the session's
model. The read-only Explore toolset makes this launch legitimate in any mode. Launch all selected agents in parallel in
one message, post `🔎 Research started — <n> agents`, then rely on native subagent progress rendering; do not build
dashboards.

Give each agent a self-contained prompt: the open questions to answer, its exact investigation scope, every
task-relevant repository constraint, the read-only boundary, and a thoroughness hint (`medium` for bounded surveys,
`very thorough` for multi-subsystem sweeps). Explore does not load project `CLAUDE.md`, so never assume those
constraints arrive implicitly. Require findings, evidence, open questions, and blockers; prohibit returning a plan or
design.

When the wave settles, read every result and fold findings and evidence into the implementation plan or the
research-only response. Surface open questions or blockers via `AskUserQuestion` only when they change scope or
approach. Research agents change nothing — do not reconcile the working tree; flag any result reporting edits as a
contract violation.

Explore agents are one-shot and return no reusable agent ID. Never apply the implementation continuation rule to them;
treat missing required evidence as an open question or blocker in the consolidated result.

For a research-only task, synthesize the evidence and finish with `### 🔎 Research handoff — <completed|blocked>`, the
agent count, findings, evidence, open questions, and blockers — replacing the Plan Phase and completion report. If the
investigation shows changes are needed, report them as findings and stop; do not produce a plan or begin edits.

## Plan Phase

Enter this phase only for an implementation handoff.

When research — delegated or Claude's own — contradicts a fact the user stated explicitly (quantities, which items,
which accounts), ask via `AskUserQuestion` before writing the plan; never widen the plan's default scope to fit the
research.

Produce a decision-complete plan with this section:

```markdown
## Claude Handoff

- Research: `<none | R1..Rn — key findings used>`
- Companion skills: `<none | $x — phases Claude runs / what is folded into briefs>`
- Strategy: `<sequential|parallel|hybrid>`
- Agents: `<1-8>` — `<why this is the smallest effective count>`
- Validation owner: `<agent-id|claude>` — `<aggregate checks it runs once>`

| Agent | Wave | Depends on | Scope              | Model            | Implementation brief                                   | Completion evidence                 |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `A1`  | `1`  | `none`     | `<files/behavior>` | `<sonnet\|opus>` | `<outcome, edits, constraints, and stopping criteria>` | `<commands and observable results>` |

- Code polish: `<required|not required>` — `<reason>`
- Agent-context polish: `<required|not required>` — `<reason>`
```

While finalizing the plan, record the union of every manifest write scope with
`ai-coord draft --name <plan-slug> '<label>' '<path>'...`, using `--recursive` only for directory scopes. Derive
`<plan-slug>` from the plan's short identity (for example `debarrel-lib`): lowercase it, replace characters outside
`[A-Za-z0-9._-]` with `-`, and truncate to 40 characters. For two or more Git roots, use
`ai-coord bundle draft --name <plan-slug> '<label>' '<absolute-path>'...`. In the plan's "Wait out conflicting agents"
section, write the exact promote command `ai-coord start --draft <plan-slug>` (or
`ai-coord bundle start --draft <plan-slug>`) and retain the explicit `ai-coord start '<label>' '<path>'...` fallback (or
`ai-coord bundle start '<label>' '<absolute-path>'...`) over the same union. A fresh implementation session must receive
these commands in the plan itself, without reconstructing scopes from prose. Use the fallback only when promotion
reports `no draft named ...`. Named drafts grant no authority and expire after seven days.

Choose the execution shape from repository evidence and the approved work:

- Sequential: one agent depends on another, write scopes overlap, or a later agent owns integration/aggregate
  validation.
- Parallel: independent work only, with explicitly disjoint write scopes; agents may inspect shared context but must not
  write outside their scope.
- Hybrid: dependency-ordered waves — run independent agents within a wave in parallel, reconcile the wave, then start
  its dependents.

A wave finishes with its slowest agent; move deferrable validation to the validation owner. If parallel work doesn't
collectively prove the plan, reserve a later sequential agent for integration and aggregate validation.

Assign aggregate validation to exactly one owner per handoff: package-wide or repo-wide checks (full test suites,
whole-package typecheck/lint, catalog-wide checks) run once — by the integration agent when one exists, otherwise by
Claude during post-wave reconciliation. Every other agent's completion evidence must be the narrowest checks proving its
own edits: file-scoped lint/format/typecheck plus targeted tests for the files it touched.

Absent a stated model preference, select each implementation agent's model from its work:

| Work                                                                                                          | Model    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Bounded, routine, or everyday implementation                                                                  | `sonnet` |
| Semantic, cross-cutting, or hardest implementation: interacting invariants or difficult algorithmic reasoning | `opus`   |

The `sonnet` and `opus` aliases resolve to Sonnet 5 and Opus 5.5 on the Anthropic API. The Agent tool exposes no
per-call effort control; subagents inherit the session's effort. Every agent runs through the `general-purpose` subagent
type; model choice and scope decomposition are the levers for balancing a wave.

Require `$code-polish` for nonlocal invariants, concurrency or state machines, migrations or parsing, auth or security,
retry or error semantics, and public API or data-contract changes; file count alone is not a trigger.

Require `$agents-brain polish` when approved work changes a target its polish workflow supports: README.md, AGENTS.md or
CLAUDE.md, a durable context doc, an existing project-installed skill under `.agents/skills`, or an existing git-tracked
source-catalog skill under `skills/` where polish is prose-only. Installed copies under managed agent-config roots
remain excluded. Mark both passes required when both trigger rules apply; mark neither when neither applies.

Do not spawn implementation subagents until the user approves the plan — the read-only research phase is the only
pre-approval exception.

## Execution Phase

### Launch

Before launching implementation subagents, promote the plan's named draft using its recorded command to acquire a
parent-owned claim covering the union of every manifest write scope. Use the recorded explicit start fallback only when
promotion reports `no draft named ...`. Name exact files individually and use `--recursive` for directory scopes;
require `READY` before launch. When promotion or start queues or blocks instead, never end the turn to pause: run
`ai-coord wait` with Bash `run_in_background: true` so its return wakes the session. It also returns on non-readiness
wake events (message, unknown coverage, work release, 300-second default timeout); on each wake, handle `MESSAGE` events
through `ai-coord inbox`, re-submit the recorded promote or start command, and diagnose stale blockers. Native subagents
inherit the parent session identity, so that claim authorizes their assigned writes. The parent owns all coordination
lifecycle commands and holds coverage through reconciliation, required polish, and commits; subagents never run
lifecycle commands. The delegate guard cannot enforce this: a Claude subagent inherits the parent's session identity and
is indistinguishable from it, so its lifecycle command would act on the parent's claim. Every brief must forbid
lifecycle commands, and subagents must never run them.

Launch each agent via the Agent tool: `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, the model from its manifest row, and a
description like `A1 — <scope>`. Start every parallel-wave agent in the same message as parallel tool calls; start
sequential agents only after reconciling their dependencies. Claude Code renders subagent progress natively — no bespoke
dashboards, polling loops, or status tables. After launch, post one compact
`🚀 Handoff started — <agent count> agents · <strategy> · <wave count> waves` line, then rely on native progress. Record
the agent ID returned with each completed implementation result for any allowed continuation.

Subagents receive none of the planning conversation. Build a self-contained, outcome-first prompt for each agent
containing:

1. The approved overall outcome plus that agent's implementation brief, dependencies, and completion evidence.
2. Its exact write scope, relevant repository constraints, known dirty-work boundaries (other agents/sessions may share
   the tree), and any prerequisite agent results.
3. Its validation assignment per the Plan Phase's validation-owner rule: the scoped checks it must run, and — for every
   agent but the owner — that it must not run the aggregate checks the owner runs once after the wave. Never brief new
   validation machinery the approved plan does not call for.
4. A soft time budget matching its manifest sizing: report blocked with partial evidence rather than grinding past it.
5. This authority boundary: inspect, edit within scope, validate locally; never commit, push, deploy, make external
   writes, or broaden scope, even when repository or host instructions favor committing promptly — committing stays with
   the orchestrator after reconciliation.
6. A delegation-context statement naming the orchestrating session by label/session-ID prefix: its claim or presence
   authorizes the assigned scope rather than conflicts with it; sibling subagents' disjoint scopes are also not
   conflicts; only an unrelated session's claim on the agent's exact assigned files justifies reporting `blocked`.
7. This stopping rule: implement the approved plan exactly; if infeasible or requiring redesign, report blocked with
   evidence instead of a replacement plan. End only with the final result or a genuine blocker — never with a progress
   summary that announces the next step, an offer to continue, a milestone report, or decisions that block nothing.
8. A requirement to end its final message with exactly these fields: `status` (`completed`/`blocked`), `summary`,
   `changed files` (only files actually touched), `verification` (every command with its outcome), `residual risks`, and
   `blockers`.

Keep each prompt as compact as completeness allows — the shared outcome summary plus that agent's own brief, scope, and
constraints; never restate the full plan text per agent.

### Collect

When an agent returns, read the required result fields and treat `changed files` as its authoritative post-pass scope.
Confirm the reported files exist or were intentionally deleted, stay within scope, and carry verification evidence
matching its assignment per the Plan Phase's validation-owner rule. After every wave, reconcile all results with the
manifest and working tree without folding in unrelated concurrent changes. Do not add agents or change models, scopes,
or validation ownership merely because a worker is slow or quiet; handle discovered follow-on work per Completion below.
When Claude is the validation owner, run the assigned aggregate checks once during this reconciliation. Attribute
aggregate-check failures before treating them as blockers: first rule out effects of the handoff's changes, formatters,
hooks, and generators, including failures in downstream files outside its write scopes. Continue past a failure only
when evidence establishes that it is unrelated and the handoff's own checks still pass. Unexpected out-of-scope edits,
overlap between agents in the same parallel wave, or an aggregate-check failure attributable to the handoff's changes
are blockers; don't start their dependents or polish, and don't silently take over implementation.

## Skill Evolution Review

Keep verified repairs to skills used during the handoff separate from the optional review below. When user or repository
instructions already authorize repairs, the parent owns their completion; subagents report evidence without expanding
their write scopes. One verified occurrence is enough, and a blocked main task does not prevent independent repairs.
Complete the handoff's required work or establish its blocker, then finish independent repairs before the final report
under the applicable maintenance policy. Plan Mode still prohibits edits.

After every required agent completes successfully and the task is verified — never for a blocked, failed, or partial
handoff — Claude alone judges (agents never recommend) whether the task exposes a stable, reusable workflow credibly
likely to recur; reject one-offs, rare contingencies, incidental cleanup, and speculative value, since size or
difficulty alone doesn't establish recurrence. For a new skill, state repo-local vs. global `~/projects/agent-skills`
placement; for a revision, name every exact skill needing change. When a proposal clears this bar, append at most one
compact suggestion (≤2 short sentences) to the existing completion report without changing its format, and offer
`$task-handoff` as the next action. Never auto-invoke `$task-handoff` or create/revise a skill during this review; when
nothing qualifies, stay silent — no placeholder, no "nothing found" note.

## Completion

- When `status: blocked` or completed work identifies a related in-repository fix or evidence change the approved
  outcome needs, treat it as follow-on work under the Contract's authorization-boundary rule, not fresh authorization:
  let already-started independent agents finish, gate dependents, extend the manifest with the smallest sufficient
  scope, satisfy repository coordination for that scope, and launch a new or reused agent. Repeat until the outcome is
  complete or a genuine authorization boundary is reached. Preserve stable IDs, dependency order, the eight-agent limit,
  and one aggregate-validation owner; include follow-on agents in final counts and report.
- Before the completion report, fix remaining same-pattern sites the approved outcome covers this way; never list them
  as optional or out-of-scope items.
- Ask the user only when continuation would change the approved outcome, require material redesign or unrelated work, or
  cross an existing confirmation boundary (destructive action, purchase, deployment, external write). Never silently
  take over implementation or relaunch solely on a different model; pass relevant completed results to dependent agents.
- Treat an Agent tool call error or a final message missing required fields, including a progress report that stops with
  work still open, as an infrastructure failure: inspect the agent's write scope for partial edits with
  `git status`/`git diff`, then continue that same agent once via `SendMessage` addressed to its returned agent ID, with
  a short verify-and-continue message naming the partially edited files (prior context preserved). This is a retry, not
  a new agent against the eight-agent limit. If no ID was returned, or the continuation fails, that agent is blocked —
  never relaunch it — except after a harness stall (e.g. `Agent stalled: no progress for 600s`) whose write scope
  `git status`/`git diff` shows untouched: relaunch it exactly once, fresh, with the same brief, outside the eight-agent
  limit.
- After every required agent completes, deduplicate the union of reported changed files and confirm the combined
  verification evidence proves the approved plan.
- If any required agent failed, or the user explicitly asked to hurry or wrap up, skip every planned polish pass and
  report the skip. Otherwise invoke each required pass once with only its applicable paths from that union —
  `$code-polish` first (default simplify-then-review mode), then `$agents-brain polish` with its eligible context
  targets; invoke only the one required pass if just one applies. Don't seed either pass with paths outside the union or
  let it broaden beyond its declared workflow authority.
- Reconcile in-scope files actually changed by each polish pass into the final changed-files set and verification. A
  required pass that blocks, fails, or writes outside its supported scope blocks later polish and cross-repository
  commits.
- If approved work changes Git repositories other than the one where the handoff began, automatically invoke `$commit`
  from each additional repository once its work, validation, and required polish are complete, scoped to files changed
  there; skip separate confirmation and never commit incomplete, blocked, unexpected, or out-of-scope changes. Push only
  when explicitly requested.
- When the handoff pushed commits and the repository defines CI workflows, such as `.github/workflows`, watch the pushed
  head's runs before the completion report (`gh run list --commit <sha>`, then `gh run watch <run-id>`, in the
  background when the host supports it). Fix failures attributable to the handoff as follow-on work and report the CI
  outcome. When changed code behaves differently by platform and local checks covered only one, name the unverified
  platforms as a risk.
- Finish with `### 🏁 Claude handoff — <completed or blocked>`, the strategy and agent count, and a compact per-agent
  result table. Follow with `### 📦 Changed` as a file tree, `### 🧪 Verification`, `### 🧹 Polish` when run, automatic
  cross-repository commit hashes when any, and `### Issues and caveats` when present; list each polish pass and outcome,
  `none` for other applicable empty values. Use `⛔ blocked` for failed required work. Keep paths, commands, hashes, and
  subagent-return fields exact and undecorated.
- Group issues and caveats as `Resolved` (verified fixes with evidence) and `Open` (remaining problems, limitations, or
  unverified assumptions, with impact and next step). Omit empty groups and the whole section when empty. Report each
  item once; put neutral context and agreed decisions under changes or scope. Reserve `blocker` for something preventing
  required work and `risk` for a specific potential adverse outcome. A workaround leaves an item open when the
  underlying issue still affects the result.
