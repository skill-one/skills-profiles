# Node Dependency Bumper

Use Taze to build one structured update plan, apply compatible ranged updates, and make major-version decisions as a
batch.

## Adding Dependencies

For a new package or CLI, use the repository's package manager and existing range convention instead of Taze. Installing
`package@latest` and retaining the package manager's resulting `^x.y.z` range is allowed. Do not replace a caret range
with an exact version merely because it can admit future releases.

When an effective package-manager minimum-release-age policy exists, it provides the freshness boundary for candidate
versions; read [references/conditional-workflows.md](references/conditional-workflows.md). The committed lockfile and
frozen deployment install provide reproducibility. Exact-pin only when the user or repository requires it, a known
compatibility constraint justifies it, or the package will run without a committed lockfile and frozen install.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the skill directory and save the helper plan from the target repository:

   ```sh
   bash <skill-dir>/scripts/run-taze.sh --plan [--include package-a,package-b] > <taze-plan.json>
   ```

   The JSON plan classifies every discovered update as `apply`, `review-major`, `review`, or `skip-fixed`. The helper
   detects monorepos, includes locked versions during scans, and mirrors Bun minimum-release-age settings. If the
   repository uses package-manager age gates or Bun catalogs, read
   [references/conditional-workflows.md](references/conditional-workflows.md) for that active branch only.

2. If `--dry-run` was requested, present the plan and counts, then stop without changing manifests or lockfiles.

3. Select every ranged minor/patch update marked `apply`. Never auto-approve a major package by name. Present all
   `review-major` and unknown updates in one decision batch with current version, target version, package role when
   discoverable, and relevant migration/release notes. Apply only the majors the user selects.

4. If nothing is selected, report the no-op and stop. If the root manifest uses Bun catalogs, preview the exact selected
   catalog transitions from the accepted plan. Pass only selected packages present in a catalog; skip the helper when
   that subset is empty:

   ```sh
   uv run <skill-dir>/scripts/update-bun-catalogs.py \
     --root <repo> --plan <taze-plan.json> --include package-a,package-b
   ```

   The preview is read-only. Missing catalog entries, conflicting plan rows, unsupported versions, or a catalog value
   that no longer matches the plan fail before writes. The helper does not select upgrades.

5. Before the first manifest or lockfile write, discover and run the repository's standard validation suite against the
   existing dependency state. Prefer its advertised aggregate check; otherwise run every exposed dependency-resolution,
   build, test, typecheck, lint, formatting-check, codegen-check, and repository-invariant command. Use frozen or
   non-writing modes where available, and record the exact commands for the post-bump rerun. Attribute every failure
   before deciding whether it blocks. Proceed when an unrelated pre-existing failure is reproducible, can be compared
   after the bump, and does not prevent dependency resolution or the checks needed to detect regressions; do not fix it
   as part of the bump. Dependency or peer-resolution conflicts, actionable unsafe behavior, or a baseline that cannot
   provide trustworthy before/after signal block the bump. In that case, stop with
   `### ⛔ Dependency bump blocked — baseline unusable` and report the exact prerequisite and diagnostics without asking
   for redundant authorization. Informational notices such as unavoidable deprecations do not block.

6. For Bun catalogs, apply the previewed transitions first: rerun `update-bun-catalogs.py` with the same plan and
   catalog include subset plus `--write`. It atomically updates every matching default/named catalog occurrence and
   preserves each existing `^`, `~`, or empty prefix. Apply before Taze, whose native catalog writes would make this
   plan stale.

   Then write all selected Taze updates in one command:

   ```sh
   bash <skill-dir>/scripts/run-taze.sh --write --include package-a,package-b
   ```

7. Run `ni` so the repository's package manager updates its lockfile.

8. Inspect the manifest and lockfile diff. Rerun the exact baseline commands, plus the narrowest checks that exercise
   the updated dependencies and any required migrations. Treat every newly introduced error, type issue, check failure
   (including tests, builds, lint, formatting, codegen, and repository invariants), dependency or peer-resolution
   conflict, and actionable compatibility or safety warning as caused by the bump unless evidence shows otherwise.

9. Fix every issue caused by the bump, including required source or configuration migrations, while preserving intended
   behavior. Do not suppress diagnostics, weaken validation, or change expected behavior merely to make checks pass.
   After each fix, rerun the affected check, then rerun the complete recorded suite and require no new failures against
   the accepted baseline. Only unrelated pre-existing failures meeting step 5's comparison requirements may remain. If
   no clear safe fix exists within the task's authority, stop with `### ⚠️ Dependency regression decision required`.
   Present all such issues in one table with the evidence, affected locations, fix and revert options, and likely
   effects. Do not report completion until the user chooses, the fix is applied or the offending update is reverted, the
   lockfile is regenerated, and the complete suite meets that same baseline-comparison requirement.

## User-Facing Output

Present plans as `### 📦 Dependency plan` with counts and a compact table:

| ID  | Plan value | Decision | Package | Current → target | Type | Notes |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------- | ---- | ----- |

Use the plan's exact `apply`, `review-major`, `review`, and `skip-fixed` values alongside plain-language decisions.
Assign stable IDs to rows needing a choice so the user can answer once. Use `### 🔎 Dry run — no files written` for a
preview and `### ✅ No selected updates` for a no-op.

Finish applied work with `### 🏁 Dependencies updated`, a tree of changed manifests/lockfiles, and
`### 🧪 Verification`. Use `### ⚠️ Remaining review` only for non-blocking informational matters, never for an
unresolved issue caused by the bump. Keep helper JSON, package/version strings, commands, and diagnostics exact and
undecorated.

## Invariants

- Fixed versions and non-semver protocols remain unchanged unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.
- Caret ranges are valid for new dependencies and CLIs; do not describe them as unreproducible when a committed lockfile
  and frozen install control resolution.
- Package arguments constrain both scan and write phases.
- The same maturity-period policy applies to scan and write.
- Bun catalog preview and write use the same accepted Taze plan and selected package set; stale plans never write.
- Do not infer compatibility from SemVer alone when repository evidence, peer ranges, or release notes indicate
  otherwise.

Completion requires an attributed, comparison-safe pre-write baseline, a reviewed plan, the retained selected updates, a
regenerated lockfile, no new failure in the recorded suite or dependency-specific checks, and no unresolved issue caused
by the bump. Dry-run completion requires the structured plan and zero writes.
