# Agents Introspection

This skill is coordination-exempt: skip the ai-coord gate for its declared work.

## Supported Chat Hosts

Before doing any work, identify the current chat host. If it is not Claude Code or Codex CLI, stop with this error:
`This skill only works in Claude Code or Codex CLI.`

If these instructions are already present in the conversation from a slash or dollar invocation, follow them directly;
do not invoke this skill again through a skill tool.

Determine whether prior Codex and Claude Code work in the current project establishes a recurrence risk for the user's
task, then recommend the smallest durable intervention justified by the evidence.

Success means the report identifies transcript coverage, separates observed behavior from inference, applies a
consistent evidence bar, and either proposes a concrete prevention step or explains why no durable change is justified.

## Input

- `<task>` (required): the task, decision, incident, or workflow to evaluate. If omitted but the current conversation
  states it clearly, use that task; otherwise ask for the missing task.

## Scope and Authority

- Inspect Codex and Claude Code transcripts whose metadata or cwd resolves to the current project and any other local
  project materially relevant to the user's task. You are authorized to read relevant other-project sessions without
  asking the user. Establish relevance from task context, explicit project or path references, a shared change or
  workflow, or session metadata; do not scan another project's history solely because it shares a basename or keyword.
- Treat current-project transcripts as internal working evidence. Include direct excerpts when they materially improve
  the report; do not summarize or redact solely because the model provider can see them. Never expose credentials,
  security secrets, or personal wallet addresses.
- Inspect and report by default. Edit AGENTS.md or skills only when the user explicitly asks to apply or implement
  fixes, then make the smallest in-scope local change and validate it.
- Never modify transcript stores. Before placing transcript evidence in a public or third-party artifact, perform an
  external-disclosure review and remove unrelated personal or customer data, unsuitable private paths or repository
  names, and unrelated transcript material. Perform external writes only when authorized.

## Bounded Retrieval

Read `references/transcript-sources.md`, resolve the current project with `pwd -P`, identify any other task-relevant
local projects, and choose 3–6 short, discriminative keywords from relevant filenames, commands, tools, errors, package
names, issue IDs, and skill names.

In a Codex read-only sandbox, or whenever `uv` cannot write its cache, skip the helper and go directly to the Manual
Fallback below; do not retry `uv run`.

1. Run the bundled miner for the current project and each task-relevant local project, unarchived sessions only, with
   the chosen keywords, `--since 60d`, `--excerpts`, and `--max-sessions 8`. Encode synonyms as one OR-group keyword
   (`--keyword 'a|b'`) rather than separate `--keyword` flags.
2. Treat source ownership as a miner invariant: every candidate is assigned once from source-native cwd, directory, and
   history metadata, never from transcript content. Review `ownership`; reject a candidate only when fallback ownership
   such as `turn_context.cwd` remains materially ambiguous for the task. The miner excludes conflicting ownership
   evidence and the live session by default.
3. Treat miner scores, themes, correction, failure, verification, tool, or `privacy_gaps` counts, redacted `excerpts`,
   and `modified` timestamps only as candidate-ranking and triage signals. They are heuristic and are never evidence by
   themselves. Inspect up to five highest-relevance transcript bodies through the bundled inspector digest
   (`scripts/transcript-inspect.py`) first; open raw bodies only when the digest is insufficient, stopping earlier when
   the evidence bar is met. Include a comparable successful session when available.
4. If evidence is insufficient, retry once with broader or OR-grouped keywords. If still weak, retry once with `--since`
   removed. If unarchived history still lacks signal, retry once with `--include-archived`.
5. Exceed these bounds only to resolve contradictory evidence or satisfy an explicitly exhaustive request. If the helper
   fails, use one project-scoped manual fallback from the reference.

Stop and report the coverage gap when the bounded fallbacks still lack useful evidence. Absence of evidence is not
evidence that a failure never occurred.

For unusually long searches, send sparse progress updates only when a retrieval fallback begins, a finding changes the
likely intervention, or the search reaches its explicit bound. Use an outcome-first line such as
`🔎 Broadening transcript search — <verified reason and bound>` or
`⏳ Checking archived sessions — <verified unarchived/archived coverage>`. Ground counts and coverage claims in
miner/tool output; do not narrate routine transcript reads.

## Evidence Contract

Evaluate historical behavior against the AGENTS.md and skill instructions available to that session when recoverable. Do
not infer that an agent ignored or misapplied a rule solely because the current source tree or installed copies under
`~/.agents/skills` or `~/.claude/skills` contain it. If the transcript does not establish the historical version or
availability, mark it unknown and qualify the attribution.

For each relevant session, record only concise, auditable observations about:

- ignored or misread AGENTS.md or skill instructions;
- wrong cwd, project root, source path, or path encoding;
- over-broad edits, unrelated churn, overwritten user work, or destructive commands;
- tooling, shell, parsing, retry, or verification mistakes;
- invented claims, vague reports, or missing tests and checks;
- successful patterns that prevented mistakes.

Connect each observation to the current task and label any causal or recurrence claim as inference. State conflicts and
weak coverage rather than averaging them away.

Use these confidence levels:

- **High**: at least two independent relevant sessions directly support the same pattern and its relevance to the
  current task.
- **Medium**: one unambiguous relevant session supports the finding, or multiple sessions provide mixed support.
- **Low**: only indirect, ambiguous, or heuristic signals exist. Do not recommend a durable repository change from
  low-confidence evidence.

A durable change requires either the same failure in at least two independent sessions or one unambiguous high-impact
failure that exposes a missing stable invariant. Treat lower-impact one-offs as manual guardrails.

## Choose the Smallest Intervention

- Update AGENTS.md when the lesson is stable, project-wide, and useful to agents working in that scope.
- Update an existing skill when the failure belongs clearly inside its current workflow.
- Propose a new skill only for a repeated, reusable procedure that spans projects or repositories.
- Add a script only when deterministic discovery, parsing, or validation would otherwise be reimplemented.
- Recommend no durable change for one-off mistakes, weak evidence, or rules already stated clearly; report the risk and
  manual guardrail instead.

## Report and Stop

Lead with `### 🔎 Introspection complete — <intervention or coverage-gap outcome>` for read-only work or
`### ✅ Introspection fixes applied — <outcome>` when explicitly requested fixes were written, then report only:

1. `🗂 Historical coverage`: project paths, sources checked, fallbacks used, and sessions inspected.
2. `🔎 Findings`: a compact table with confidence, observed evidence, inference, relevance, and intervention. Keep
   confidence visibly separate from severity or impact.
3. `🛡 Durable recommendations`: apply now, consider later, or no change, with the target and prevention mechanism.
4. `🧪 Validation and gaps`: commands run, checks performed, external-disclosure constraints, and missing evidence.

When fixes were explicitly requested, include exact files changed and validation outcomes. Stop after the current task
has an evidence-backed recommendation or an explicit coverage gap; do not mine additional history merely to add examples
or strengthen prose. Keep transcript references, paths, counters, redactions, and miner JSON exact and undecorated.
