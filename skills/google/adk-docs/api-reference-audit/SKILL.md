# ADK API reference doc auditor (api-ref-audit)

This skill audits the API reference documentation in the
[adk-docs](https://github.com/google/adk-docs) repository across every language
SDK and reports what is out of date. It is a **reporting and guidance** skill:
it detects drift, recommends the correct per-surface release process, and emits
an executable plan only when the user explicitly asks. It does **not** edit
files, run generators, or open PRs by default.

The audit covers three kinds of drift:

1. **Generated API reference docs** under `docs/api-reference/` that lag behind
   the latest SDK release.
2. **Hardcoded version strings** in prose and examples (dependency coordinates,
   `pom.xml` versions) that must be bumped with each Java/Kotlin release.
3. **Code-sample drift** (light flagging only): samples that reference pinned
   versions or obviously deprecated APIs. Deep sample verification is out of
   scope of this skill.

> re-derive it if a lookup fails, rather than trusting the table blindly.

## Version map (in-repo version vs. upstream truth)

Each **surface** is one API reference output this repo ships: Python API, Python
CLI, Python REST API, Python Agent Config, TypeScript, Go, Java, and Kotlin.

For each surface, read the in-repo version from the file listed, then compare it
against the latest upstream release and package registry.

| Surface | In-repo version marker | Upstream repo | Package registry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python API | `docs/api-reference/python/_static/documentation_options.js` (`VERSION:`) | `google/adk-python` | PyPI `google-adk` |
| Python CLI | `docs/api-reference/cli/_static/documentation_options.js` (`VERSION:`) and `docs/api-reference/cli/index.html` ("ADK X.Y.Z") | `google/adk-python` | PyPI `google-adk` |
| Python REST API | `docs/api-reference/rest/openapi.json` (`info.version`) | `google/adk-python` | PyPI `google-adk` |
| Python Agent Config | no version marker; diff the type set in `agentconfig/index.html` against upstream `AgentConfig.json` | `google/adk-python` (same release as Python API/CLI/REST) | n/a |
| TypeScript | `docs/api-reference/typescript/variables/version.html` (the `version` const); cross-check `docs/api-reference/typescript/index.html` (`<title>` "... - vX.Y.Z") | `google/adk-js` (monorepo; see note) | npm `@google/adk` (authoritative) |
| Go | external, hosted on `pkg.go.dev`; verify links in `docs/api-reference/index.md` | `google/adk-go` | `pkg.go.dev` |
| Java | `docs/api-reference/java/index.html` (`<title>` "Maven Parent POM X.Y.Z API") | `google/adk-java` (authoritative) | Maven Central `com.google.adk:google-adk` (lags; cross-check only) |
| Kotlin | `docs/api-reference/kotlin/index.html` (version string near the header) | `google/adk-kotlin` (authoritative) | Maven Central `com.google.adk:google-adk-kotlin-core` (lags; cross-check only) |

Notes:

- Python API, CLI, and REST all track the **same** `adk-python` release, so they
  usually move together. Flag it when they diverge.
- Python Agent Config has no version field. Parse the **keys of the `$defs`
  object** (plus top-level `oneOf` variants) from the upstream
  `AgentConfig.json` at the target tag, e.g. `jq '."$defs" | keys'`. Do not
  substring-grep for `*Config`: that mixes property names (camelCase, e.g.
  `imageConfig`) with type names (PascalCase, e.g. `ImageConfig`) and produces
  false drift. Check each `$defs` key as a whole word against
  `agentconfig/index.html`; a key present upstream but missing in the page (or
  vice versa) is drift.
- TypeScript: use npm `@google/adk` `dist-tags.latest` as the authoritative
  version. adk-js is a monorepo with package-prefixed tags (e.g. `main-v1.4.0`,
  `integrations-v1.4.0`), so `gh ... releases/latest` can return a release for a
  different package instead of `@google/adk`. The in-repo `version` const tracks
  the same `@google/adk` package npm publishes and releases together with it, so
  compare the two directly: any version difference means the docs are behind.
  The generate script clones the `adk-v<version>` tag (the core `@google/adk`
  package tag).
- Go docs are not built into this repo. Confirm the release version and that the
  `index.md` links point at the correct major versions (e.g. v2.x and v1.x). Go
  versions are also pinned in `examples/go/go.mod` / `go.sum` and appear as
  `/adk/v2` import paths in prose (e.g. `docs/events/index.md`, `docs/2.0/`), so
  check those too.

## Hardcoded version references

These version-pinned strings are intentional and useful: they show developers
the exact dependency versions to use. The audit's job is to keep them current,
not remove them. They drift with each Java/Kotlin release and are bumped in a
separate PR (see the process map). Discover current occurrences by grep; do not
trust the file list alone, as new pages might appear over time.

- **Grep targets**:
    - `com.google.adk:google-adk` and `com.google.adk:google-adk-kotlin` across
      `docs/**/*.md`
    - `<google-adk.version>` across `docs/**/*.md` and `examples/java/**/pom.xml`
    - bare `google-adk>=X.Y.Z` pins in integration pages (report only; these are
      minimum-version pins, not doc-version bumps)
- **Known files that carry these (verify, do not assume complete)**:
    - `docs/get-started/installation.md`
    - `docs/get-started/java.md`
    - `docs/get-started/kotlin.md`
    - `docs/live/get-started/streaming-java.md`
    - `docs/deploy/cloud-run.md`
    - `docs/agents/models/litert-lm.md`
    - `docs/integrations/firestore-session-service.md`
    - `examples/java/**/pom.xml`

- **Never flag or bump language support tags.** Versions that are inside of
  `language-support-tag` spans (e.g. `<span class="lst-python">Python
  v1.32.0</span>`) mark the release a feature was *introduced* in, not the
  latest published version. Leave them untouched; bumping them misrepresents
  when the feature became available.

## Per-surface process map (owner, tooling, steps)

Treat each entry as a starting hint. Before recommending it, confirm the script
still exists and inspect the most recent matching bump PR to confirm the current
process.

- **Python API**: self-serve. Run `bash tools/python-api-docs/generate.sh
  <version>`, then open a PR (the script injects the Google Analytics tag via
  Sphinx).
- **Python CLI**: self-serve. Run `bash tools/python-cli-docs/generate.sh
  <version>`, then open a PR. The GA tag is injected via a Sphinx layout
  template in the script.
- **Python REST API**: self-serve. Run `bash
  tools/python-rest-api-docs/generate.sh <version>`, then open a PR. GA tag is
  baked into the generated `index.html`.
- **Python Agent Config**: regenerated from the adk-python schema with
  `json-schema-for-humans`; no `tools/` generate script exists yet, so treat the
  update as manual.
- **TypeScript**: self-serve, one PR. Run `bash
  tools/typescript-api-docs/generate.sh <version>` (where `<version>` is the npm
  `@google/adk` version from the audit), then open a PR. The script clones the
  adk-js `adk-v<version>` tag, adds the version to the page title via TypeDoc's
  `--includeVersion`, and injects the Google Analytics tag into every HTML file
  (awk post-processing).
- **Java**: two separate PRs per release. The adk-java team pushes the built
  Javadoc assets (title `chore: update ADK Java doc to version <X>`); the docs
  maintainer bumps the hardcoded dependency versions and `pom.xml` values (title
  `Update ADK Java dependency versions to <X>`). The two can lag each other; the
  assets PR is not self-serve, the dependency bump is.
- **Kotlin**: self-serve, one PR. Run `bash tools/kotlin-api-docs/generate.sh
  <version>`, then open a PR that bundles the generated assets and the hardcoded
  Kotlin refs (`installation.md`, `get-started/kotlin.md`, `litert-lm.md`). The
  GA tag is auto-injected into every HTML file.

### Verify the process

- Confirm each referenced script exists under `tools/` before recommending it.
- Inspect the last matching bump to confirm the real, current process and the
  files it touched, for example:
    - `gh pr list --repo google/adk-docs --state merged --search "Kotlin"`
    - `gh pr list --repo google/adk-docs --state merged --search "CLI reference"`
    - `gh pr list --repo google/adk-docs --state merged --search "Java"`
    - `gh pr list --repo google/adk-docs --state merged --search "TypeScript"`

## Audit workflow

### Step 1: Read in-repo versions

For every surface in the version map, read the marker file and record the
current version. Use `grep`/`Read` for the JS and HTML markers and parse
`info.version` from `rest/openapi.json`. If a marker path does not resolve,
re-derive it (search the generated output) and note the discrepancy.

### Step 2: Fetch upstream releases and registry versions

For each SDK, get the latest release and the latest published package:

- GitHub latest release and tags:
    - `gh api repos/google/adk-python/releases/latest --jq .tag_name`
    - Repeat for `adk-go`, `adk-kotlin`, `adk-java`.
    - For `adk-js`, do not use `releases/latest` (monorepo tags are
      package-prefixed, e.g. `main-v1.4.0`); use npm `@google/adk` as the source
      of truth.
- Package registries:
    - PyPI: fetch `https://pypi.org/pypi/google-adk/json` and read `info.version`.
    - npm: fetch `https://registry.npmjs.org/@google/adk` and read
      `dist-tags.latest`.
    - Maven Central: query
      `https://search.maven.org/solrsearch/select?q=g:com.google.adk+AND+a:google-adk&rows=1&wt=json`
      and read `latestVersion` (use `a:google-adk-kotlin-core` for Kotlin).
- **For Java and Kotlin, treat the GitHub release/tag as authoritative.** The
  Maven Central search index frequently lags real releases (it has returned
  versions older than what is already shipped in this repo). Use the registry
  only as a cross-check, and when it disagrees with the GitHub tag, trust the
  tag and note the lag.
- Note when a GitHub tag and its registry version disagree (a release may be
  tagged but not yet published, or vice versa); report both.

### Step 3: Classify each surface

Mark each surface as one of:

- **Up to date**: in-repo version equals the latest upstream release.
- **Behind**: in-repo version is older than the latest release (report the gap,
  e.g. `2.3.0 -> 2.4.1`).
- **Unknown / manual**: upstream lookup failed, or a surface with no automatable
  check. Agent Config is not "unknown"; classify it via the type-set diff
  (Behind if types were added or removed upstream).

Call out the common case where Python API, CLI, and REST should share the same
`adk-python` version but do not.

For Agent Config, run the type-set diff described in the version map Notes to
decide Up to date vs. Behind.

### Step 4: Check hardcoded version references

Grep the targets in "Hardcoded version references" and compare each pinned
version to the latest Java and Kotlin releases. List every file and line that
needs a bump. Keep minimum-version pins (`google-adk>=X.Y.Z`) separate; only
flag them if they reference a version newer than what is released or are clearly
stale.

### Step 5: Light code-sample drift flag

Do a quick scan (not a deep audit): note samples with hardcoded model or package
versions, obviously deprecated imports, or patterns superseded by a new
release's changelog. Report these as hints and recommend a dedicated
sample-audit pass for deep verification. Do not attempt to rewrite samples here.

### Step 6: Verify Go links

Confirm `docs/api-reference/index.md` links point at the correct Go major
versions on `pkg.go.dev` and that the latest `adk-go` release is represented.
Also check the pinned versions in `examples/go/go.mod` / `go.sum` and the
`/adk/v2` import paths in prose (e.g. `docs/events/index.md`, `docs/2.0/`).

## Report format

Produce a Markdown report. Lead with a status table, then prioritized findings.

Status table (one row per surface):

| Surface | In-repo | Latest upstream | Status | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Prioritized findings after the table. List only items that require action; do
not emit "no action" or "confirmed correct" lines anywhere, including inside an
otherwise-actionable finding. If a surface needs nothing, its table row already
says so.

- 🔴 **Out of date / broken**: a surface multiple releases behind, a
  broken/incorrect API-reference link, or version markers that disagree with
  each other (e.g. Python API/CLI/REST on different versions).
- 🟠 **Stale hardcoded versions**: `file:line` list of dependency coordinates and
  `pom.xml` values to bump, with old -> new.
- 🟡 **Sample-drift hints**: samples that likely need updating; recommend the
  deep sample-audit pass.

For each stale surface, name the **recommended process** from the process map
(self-serve script, wait on team, or manual) so the user knows how to proceed.

After the report, **stop**. Do not modify files, run generators, or open PRs
unless the user explicitly asks.

## Executable plan (only when asked)

When the user asks you to proceed, output concrete next actions per stale
surface:

- The exact command to run, when self-serve, for example:
    - `bash tools/python-cli-docs/generate.sh <new-version>`
    - `bash tools/python-rest-api-docs/generate.sh <new-version>`
    - `bash tools/kotlin-api-docs/generate.sh <new-version>`
    - `bash tools/typescript-api-docs/generate.sh <new-version>`
- For team-owned surfaces (Java), state that the update is blocked on the owning
  team's asset PR and what to request or wait for.
- For hardcoded versions, the precise `file:line` edits (old -> new), including
  `examples/java/**/pom.xml`.
- Which surfaces move together (Python API, CLI, and REST share one `adk-python`
  version) so they ship as separate PRs, one per surface, bumped in the same
  sitting.
- A PR description per stale surface, following the repo convention:
    - a short bullet summary of what changed
    - `Rendered page:` <preview link, where applicable>
    - upstream release link and version
- A final note telling the user how to proceed: self-run the commands, wait on
  the owning team, or have the agent execute the plan.

### PR title conventions

Match the established titles so history stays searchable:

- Python API: `Update API reference docs for ADK Python <X.Y.Z>`
- Python CLI: `Update CLI reference docs for ADK Python <X.Y.Z>`
- Python REST API: `Update REST API reference docs for ADK Python <X.Y.Z>`
- TypeScript: `Update API reference docs for ADK TypeScript <X.Y.Z>`
- Java dependency bump: `Update ADK Java dependency versions to <X.Y.Z>`
- Kotlin: `Update ADK Kotlin to <X.Y.Z>`

## Style rules to bake in

- Report versions precisely as `old -> new`; never guess a version you did not
  read from a marker or fetch from upstream.
- Do not invent links; use only markers you read and releases you fetched.
- No em dashes or verbose AI-generated content.
- The canonical source repositories are listed in
  `docs/community/contributing-guide.md`.
