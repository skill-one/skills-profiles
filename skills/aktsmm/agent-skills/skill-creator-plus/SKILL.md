# Skill Creator+

Design and review reusable skills that trigger reliably and stay lean.

## Decision Flow

Start by deciding whether the user really needs a skill.

| Need                                                                        | Use              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Reusable multi-step workflow with bundled scripts, references, or templates | **Skill**        |
| Single focused slash task with parameterized input                          | **Prompt**       |
| Always-on or file-scoped guidance                                           | **Instruction**  |
| Persona, tool restrictions, delegation, or handoffs                         | **Custom Agent** |
| Deterministic enforcement or lifecycle automation                           | **Hook**         |

If the answer is not **Skill**, stop and create the right primitive instead.

## When to Use

- **Create skill**, **/create-skill**, **new skill**, **review skill**, **fix skill trigger**, **SKILL.md**, **workflow**, **スキル作成**
- Creating a new skill from scratch
- Extracting a repeated workflow from a conversation, incident, or checklist
- Updating or refactoring an existing skill
- Reviewing existing SKILL.md files
- Deciding whether a customization should be a skill before authoring it

## Start Here

1. Extract the workflow you want to package.
2. Clarify only the missing dimensions: target outcome, personal vs workspace scope, checklist vs full workflow.
3. Draft the smallest useful SKILL.md, then move detail into references.

## License And Validation Gate

Classify the target before creating or changing it: **self-authored**,
**third-party**, or **derivative**. A self-authored target uses independent
content; copying this Skill's prose, code, templates, or notices makes it a
derivative and requires preserved upstream evidence.

For a new self-authored Skill, propose `CC BY-NC-SA 4.0` as a candidate, show
the exact display attribution, and get confirmation. Do not silently copy this
Skill's Apache-2.0 license into the target. Preserve an existing or upstream
license when updating or importing.

Use the [target license profiles](references/target-license-profiles.json) and
[validation lanes](references/validation-lanes.md). Baseline review is always
required; Python helpers and packaging are conditional.

### Gotchas

- `init_skill.py --path` takes the **existing parent directory**; the target becomes `<path>/<skill_name>`. Passing the skill directory itself nests a duplicate.
- Three artifacts are generated: `SKILL.md`, `LICENSE.txt`, `skill-license.json`.
- `quick_validate.py` compares `LICENSE.txt` **content exactly** against the rendered template and requires `metadata.author` to equal `authorAttribution.value` character for character. Never hand-edit `LICENSE.txt`; regenerate it with the tool and copy the result over.
- **A passing gate proves consistency, not correctness.** The manifest hashes whatever the template rendered, so a broken template yields a broken notice that still validates. Read the rendered `LICENSE.txt` once after scaffolding.
- Classification turns on whether the **source** is independently authored, not on the act of copying. Reusing your own material stays `self-authored`; `PROVENANCE.md` and `upstreamAttributions` are required only for `third-party` and `derivative`.
- A Skill with no `skill-license.json` is treated as legacy and skips the content comparison, so repairing a shared template does not invalidate older Skills.
- When importing a Skill into another repository, regenerate `LICENSE.txt` and `skill-license.json` with **that** repository's toolchain. The manifest pins the template hash, so a copied pair fails validation there.

## Core Principles

| Principle                  | Description                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concise is Key**         | Context window is shared. Only add what Claude doesn't already know. |
| **Discovery First**        | The description is the routing surface. Triggers must be explicit.   |
| **Degrees of Freedom**     | Match specificity to task fragility (high/medium/low freedom)        |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Split into 3 levels: Metadata → Body → References                    |
| **Integrate Before Add**   | Update, merge, or replace existing guidance before appending more.   |
| **Right Primitive**        | A good skill is not a fallback for prompt/agent/instruction design.  |
| **Scope Before File**      | Decide workspace vs profile before creating anything.                |
| **Self-Contained**         | The skill must carry its own knowledge. Bundle into references/scripts; do not just link to workspace files (instructions, memory, ledgers) that die when copied elsewhere. Abstract env-specific values (paths, names) into args/config. |

> **Default assumption:** Claude is already very smart. Challenge each piece: "Does this justify its token cost?"

Before adding a new section, ask whether it can replace an existing rule, move to `references/`, or be dropped as session-specific.

## Skill Structure

Keep routing and decisions in `SKILL.md`; put deterministic helpers in `scripts/`, on-demand detail in `references/`, and reusable outputs in `assets/`. References load on demand and are often never read, so any constraint that gates an irreversible action — allowlists, forbidden values, safety limits — stays inline in `SKILL.md` even when it reads like detail, with only its rationale in `references/`. See [Skill Structure](references/skill-structure.md), including excluded files.

## Creation Process

Use [Creation Process](references/creation-process.md): choose primitive and scope, extract the reusable workflow, plan resources, implement, validate, and test real trigger prompts.

## Clarify if Needed

- What outcome should this skill produce?
- Should it live in workspace scope or personal scope?
- Is a short checklist enough, or does it need a full multi-step workflow?

### Refactor Order

When improving an existing skill, use this order:

1. Delete stale or low-value guidance
2. Merge duplicate rules
3. Move long detail to `references/`
4. Add genuinely missing guidance last

## Frontmatter and Triggering

Use the smallest viable frontmatter: `name`, `description`, and only behavior-changing optional fields. `name` must match the folder and `description` must include trigger conditions.

Frontmatter details and silent failures: [references/common-pitfalls.md](references/common-pitfalls.md)

## SKILL.md Guidelines

Keep `SKILL.md` lean: <150 lines is good, >300 lines must split to references. Start `When to Use` with user phrases, keep essential workflow only, and push long examples / schemas / recipes to references.

Detailed review criteria: [references/skill-review-checklist.md](references/skill-review-checklist.md)

## Iteration Loop

1. Draft the skill and save it.
2. Identify the weakest or most ambiguous parts.
3. Tighten those parts, then summarize what the skill produces and example prompts to try.

## Review Checklist

Use [references/skill-review-checklist.md](references/skill-review-checklist.md). For bloat review, use [references/skill-bloat-review.md](references/skill-bloat-review.md).

## Key References

Use [primitive choice](references/customization-primitives.md), [structure](references/skill-structure.md), [creation](references/creation-process.md), [review checklist](references/skill-review-checklist.md), [bloat review](references/skill-bloat-review.md), and [common pitfalls](references/common-pitfalls.md). The [structure gallery](references/skill-structure-gallery.md), [workflows](references/workflows.md), and [output patterns](references/output-patterns.md) are optional examples.

## Done Criteria

- [ ] Request is confirmed to be a skill, not another primitive
- [ ] Scope is decided before file creation
- [ ] SKILL.md created and under 150 lines
- [ ] Frontmatter has name + description with trigger conditions
- [ ] Manually used skills have `argument-hint`
- [ ] `user-invocable` is set intentionally
- [ ] Optional fields are added only when they change behavior
- [ ] Details moved to references/ (Progressive Disclosure)
- [ ] Self-Contained: no hard reference to other skills / workspace files; env-specific values (paths, customer names, tenant IDs) abstracted
- [ ] Review checklist passed
