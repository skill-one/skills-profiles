# Visualize As Infographic

Turn a conversation summary, topic, file, skill, or workflow into 2-3 polished infographic PNGs. Generate one self-contained HTML file per pattern, render PNGs, inspect every PNG, fix visual defects, and report usable outputs.

## When To Use

- User asks for `インフォグラフィック`, `図解`, `挿絵`, `章扉`, `X投稿用画像`, `OGP`, `visualize`, or `HTML→PNG`.
- User wants multiple visual directions, not a single text-only slide.
- The artifact should be shareable as PNG and reproducible from HTML.

## Inputs

- Target: explicit argument if provided; otherwise summarize the latest relevant session context.
- Usage: default is X / SNS. If the user mentions book chapter inserts, OGP, slide, or PDF, adapt the ratio and style.
- If brightness, signature/title text, or aspect ratio are unspecified, ask once before authoring with compact choices:
  - Brightness: default dark / brighter / white background
  - Signature or title mark: default none / small mark / specify text
  - Ratio: default X multi-pattern / 16:9 only / square only
- Treat `default` as the normal fallback when the user says default or gives no preference. Do not use a separate `omakase` option when it means the same thing as default.
- Ask additional clarifying questions only if the output would materially change.

## Output Defaults

- Create 2-3 different patterns, one HTML per pattern.
- Save under `output/<topic>-diagrams/`.
- File names:
  - HTML: `<topic>-<pattern>.html`
  - PNG: `<topic>-<pattern>.png`
- Common ratios:
  - X / SNS: 1200x675 and/or 1200x1200
  - Blog OGP: 1200x630
  - Chapter insert / book figure: match the book tone; prefer calm, high-readable layouts over flashy decoration.

## Design Rules

- Use visual hierarchy: title, short lead, 3-6 visual units, concise footer if useful.
- Match explanatory labels to the artifact's audience language. For Japanese articles, use natural Japanese for titles, captions, status labels, and generic UI; keep product names, API fields, and other proper nouns in their official form. Avoid literal labels that sound unnatural, such as `段階で採点`, when `定義した基準のどの段階に近いか` is the intended meaning.
- Read numeric claims from the source artifact or SSOT instead of retyping them. For latency, cost, accuracy, and token values, state the measurement boundary in or next to the image: per request, serial total, fresh-process end to end, estimate, or saved-result playback.
- If an infographic depicts motion or elapsed time, state inside the asset whether movement is illustrative or timed from measurements. Animation duration must not be presented as API or processing latency unless frames are generated from those timestamps.
- Avoid information overload. If text looks dense, split into another pattern rather than shrinking aggressively.
- Set `html, body` to exact poster `width` / `height` and `overflow: hidden`.
- Use Noto Sans JP for Japanese poster text unless a project-specific style says otherwise.
- Use stable dimensions for cards, badges, rails, and panels so text or icons cannot push adjacent elements.
- For chapter inserts, match the book's palette and mood; do not force SNS-dark neon styling if the publication design is quiet.
- Do not add signatures, account names, license text, or skill names unless the user asks.
- Do not render usage labels or production notes such as `X main`, `best use`, or `list + highlight` in image corners. Keep usage and recommendation notes in the completion report only.

## Rendering Procedure

1. Create the output folder.
2. Create independent HTML files. Do not pack multiple patterns into one HTML.
3. Render with Playwright. Prefer Python Playwright if available. A helper script is provided: [render_infographics.py](./scripts/render_infographics.py).
4. Use viewport-size clipping, not `fullPage`, when decorative elements can overflow the poster. `fullPage` may capture off-canvas decoration and create white margins.
5. Use `domcontentloaded` plus a short fixed wait if external fonts make `load` or `networkidle` hang.
6. Use `device_scale_factor=1` when the PNG must be the stated size. Use `2` only when high-density output is desired and the larger pixel dimensions are acceptable.
7. Prefer `container-type: inline-size` when only width-relative units such as `cqw` are needed. With `container-type: size`, give the wrapper a definite block size or an intrinsic fallback: full size containment ignores descendants when resolving an auto block size, so the wrapper can collapse to an empty-box height while a descendant's `scrollHeight` stays nonzero.
8. Inspect every PNG with `view_image`.
9. Inspect at the target embed width as well as full size. A 1200px image that is readable full-size can become illegible when embedded near 360px on mobile.
10. If any PNG has overlap, clipping, unreadable text, wrong order, unexpected margins, wrong pixel size, or excessive density, fix the HTML or renderer, render again, and re-check that PNG.
11. Do not send final until all PNGs have completed `inspect -> fix if needed -> rerender -> re-inspect`.

## Visual QA Checklist

- No text overlaps other text, icons, rails, cards, or borders.
- No content is clipped at the image edge.
- No unintended white margins or oversized canvas from screenshot capture.
- Pixel dimensions match the promised output size unless high-density output was explicitly chosen.
- Step numbers and visual order match DOM / reading order.
- In named comparison plots, label points near their marks or connect them visibly to names at the target embed width; do not make readers decode numbered points from a distant legend alone.
- Card text fits without cramped line breaks.
- Contrast is readable on the final PNG, not just in HTML.
- Generic English UI does not remain in a Japanese artifact unless it is part of a quoted product surface.
- Numeric values and caveats agree with their source artifact, and an image shared alone cannot confuse illustrative playback with measured latency.
- A blank or short capture is treated as a defect to diagnose, not an empty design. Check the wrapper's computed height before blaming the content.
- The final answer refers to the current infographic request, not an older topic from the conversation.

## Completion Report

Provide a compact table:

| PNG | Size | Pattern | Best use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Then recommend one image to use first and explain why in one sentence.

## Do Not

- Do not report completion after generating PNGs but before inspecting them.
- Do not leave a known-bad PNG as a recommended output.
- Do not invent numeric claims, quotes, or external facts that are not in the source material.
- Do not use hardcoded local absolute paths inside generated HTML.
