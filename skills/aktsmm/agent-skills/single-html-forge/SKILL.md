# Single HTML Forge

One HTML file. No CDN, no build step, no external fetch at runtime. Opens the same on any machine and survives being emailed.

## When to Use

- "HTMLスライドを作って" / "単一HTMLで資料にして" / "ブラウザーで開ける説明資料にして" / "サマリ画像を1枚"
- Handing a deck or explainer to someone who should not need PowerPoint
- Embedding images into a self-contained HTML artifact
- Re-verifying or editing an artifact this skill produced

Not for: PPTX output (this skill does not produce it), editable diagram source files, or anything needing a live server.

## Archetype Routing

Ask which one unless the request already says. Load only that archetype's reference.

| Archetype | Shape                                            | Use for                           | Reference                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `deck`    | 16:9 slides, keyboard nav, presenter overlay     | talks, walkthroughs               | [archetype-deck.md](references/archetype-deck.md)     |
| `doc`     | vertical scroll, sidebar nav, numbered citations | explainers, comparisons, handouts | [archetype-doc.md](references/archetype-doc.md)       |
| `poster`  | one fixed canvas, exported as PNG                | summary images, social cards      | [archetype-poster.md](references/archetype-poster.md) |

`deck` includes a collapsible sidebar, settings menu, fullscreen, optional sound and reduced-motion-aware effects. Start from `deck-outline-skeleton.html` for reading/review, `deck-skeleton.html` for single-slide presentation, or `deck-motion-skeleton.html` for a worked step example. Both views can switch without losing position. Preserve chapter groups; finalize with thumbnails for a visual sidebar (see the deck reference).

## Intake

1. Archetype (above).
2. Topic, audience, what they should be able to do or decide afterwards, and roughly how much content.
3. Colour direction — propose two or three, or derive one from the topic. See [design-tokens.md](references/design-tokens.md).
4. Images? If any is a screenshot or of unknown provenance, ask the sanitization question in Hard Constraints **before** embedding.
5. Which export, if any: PDF, PNG, or per-slide PNG. Produce only what was asked for.
6. For editable notes or forms, resolve the capability gap before promising implementation: the bundled player has no free-text input or persistence. Offer a static worksheet only with agreement; otherwise route to an application workflow. Do not patch the pinned runtime to disguise an unsupported requirement.

## Hard Constraints

These gate the output. They are here, not in a reference, because a reference may never be read.

- **No artifact-specific JavaScript or CSS.** Script is the bundled runtime only; styling is the fixed template plus typed custom properties. Any other `<script>` or `<style>` fails verification.
- **Images ride in a `data:` URI on an `<img>`, or in allowlisted inline SVG.** Nothing else may carry a resource — not CSS `url()`, not `srcset`, not `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<iframe>`, `<video>`, `<link>`, and never `srcdoc`.
- **No web fonts.** System font stack only. Glyphs will differ across machines; say so rather than claiming pixel fidelity.
- **Do not generate brand logos or trademarks.**
- **Never write a customer name, tenant name, subscription id, or internal hostname into the output.**
- **Before embedding a screenshot or an image of unknown provenance, ask: "is this sanitized for publication?"** On "no" or "not sure", stop and mask it first ([mask_image.py](scripts/mask_image.py)). A text scan cannot see a name rendered inside an image, so this judgement stays with the user. Re-ask if the image changes.
- **Prefer the active workspace's instructions** for colour and formatting when they exist; otherwise use this skill's defaults.
- **Never call an artifact finished on Tier 1 alone.** Without the browser pass, report it as `UNVERIFIED`.

## Build Flow

1. **Storyboard first and stop there.** Open with one sentence for the whole artifact — where it starts, what it passes through, where it lands — then one row per slide or section: the id it will keep, its visible title, the assertion it makes, and the block that carries it. For a deck with six or more slides or multiple topics, assign every slide to one of 3–5 chapters before drafting. Wait for the user's answer before opening a skeleton.

    | id  | visible title | assertion              | block           |
    | --- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
    | s2  | 鍵の管理      | 鍵は保管するのをやめる | `shf-cards` × 2 |

    Assertions drive the content; they do not have to become the displayed heading. In business and review decks, prefer concise noun-phrase titles and carry the full claim in the lead or body. Use sentence titles only when their rhetorical force is intentional ([anti-slop.md](references/anti-slop.md)). One wrong line is free to fix here and costs a rebuild plus a re-verify once twelve slides exist. Skip only for a poster, or when the user arrives with the structure already settled. If the user hands the rest back, fill it provisionally and mark which rows they never saw.

2. Copy the skeleton for the chosen archetype from `assets/skeletons/`.
3. Replace the content, using the storyboard ids as `data-slide-id` and section `id`. Keep them stable — they are the handles for later edits.
  For a draft corresponding to another format, preserve claims, examples, caveats, citations, and diagram relationships; compare visible slide content, not merely hidden notes or JSON. Record any approved reduction rather than treating "draft" as permission to summarize.
4. Adjust colours by editing `<style id="shf-theme">` only; that block is the whole design system, so carrying it into the next artifact is how a series stays consistent. Never touch `<style id="shf-css">` or `<script id="shf-runtime">`; both are hash-pinned.
5. For each image: `embed_assets.py`, then paste the `dataUri` into an `<img>` with `alt` and `data-asset-ref`, and add the asset entry to `<script id="shf-model">`.
6. For deck steps or thumbnails, run `export_html.py draft.html --finalize final.html --thumbnails` (omit `--thumbnails` for a title-only sidebar). This verifies the draft, builds embedded previews and complete static print pages, then verifies the final HTML before saving. After editing slide content, finalize again; do not hand-edit derived images or print pages.
7. Verify, then export only the requested format. Choose effects only where they explain order, change or focus; do not animate every slide merely because the player supports it. Sound starts off and is a recipient choice.

Changing anything under `assets/runtime/` or `assets/css/` means re-running `build_skeletons.py`, which regenerates the skeletons and re-pins the registry.

## Verification Gate

```
python scripts/verify_html.py <artifact.html> --tier2
```

- **Tier 1** is standard library only and always runs: canonical grammar, element and attribute allowlist, pinned-region hashes, theme tokens, model and asset closure, data URI decode, image metadata, link schemes, size budget.
- **Tier 2** needs Playwright: blocks all network egress, walks every slide, waits for images to finish decoding, then checks for zero-size images, missing viewBox, overflow, and console errors.

Exit codes: `0` PASS, `1` FAIL, `2` UNVERIFIED. Anything but `0` means do not ship it.

Fast path uses the target viewport and requested export. If mobile or responsive use is promised, also walk the final artifact at the narrow target width; a desktop PASS does not cover it. Never skip single-file-ness, image decode, overflow, navigation, or the sanitization question. Report untested capabilities separately.

## Scripts

| Script                                           | Needs                       | Purpose                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [verify_html.py](scripts/verify_html.py)         | stdlib (Tier 2: Playwright) | the gate                            |
| [build_skeletons.py](scripts/build_skeletons.py) | stdlib                      | rebuild skeletons and re-pin hashes |
| [embed_assets.py](scripts/embed_assets.py)       | stdlib (resize: Pillow)     | fetch, strip metadata, encode       |
| [mask_image.py](scripts/mask_image.py)           | Pillow                      | mask rectangles before embedding    |
| [export_html.py](scripts/export_html.py)         | Playwright                  | PDF / PNG                           |
| [test_verify.py](scripts/test_verify.py)         | stdlib                      | proves the gate actually fails      |

Missing Pillow or Playwright stops the affected step with installation guidance. It never silently degrades.

## Requirements

A harness with file read/write and Python 3.x. Everything in this folder is self-contained; copy it anywhere and it still works.

## Done Criteria

- [ ] Archetype confirmed with the user
- [ ] Storyboard agreed, or the skip recorded (poster / structure already settled)
- [ ] Claims that could not be backed are named for the user, or the artifact makes none
- [ ] `verify_html.py --tier2` exits `0`; a Tier 1-only run is reported as `UNVERIFIED`
- [ ] Every image has `alt`, a model entry, and a sanitization answer if it is a screenshot
- [ ] Only the requested exports exist
- [ ] Output carries no customer, tenant, or subscription identifiers
