# Implement with subagents

Keep orchestration and implementation ownership separate: the controller
schedules, and one implementation subagent owns each work item through
completion. Validate task dependencies before dispatch. Run only ready,
independent tasks concurrently in isolated worktrees; integrate accepted commits
in dependency order and recheck affected evidence at the integrated head. Use
serial execution when safe isolation or capacity is unavailable. Return failed
acceptance evidence to the same owner, never repair it in the controller.

## Check the prerequisite

Review mode has no external dependency. Implementation mode requires the
`implement` skill from [Matt Pocock's skill set](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills).
It is not bundled here. Never install it implicitly; report
`npx skills add mattpocock/skills` and require the user to select `implement`,
`tdd`, and `code-review` when it is absent.

## Select the mode

- Use `review` only to assess supplied orchestration without running it.
- Use `implement` only to execute supplied tickets or plan tasks.

## Review procedure

1. Inspect only permitted repository and orchestration state. Do not start an
   agent, edit, commit, or contact a remote service.
2. Assess queue atomicity, dependency order, implementation ownership,
   task-scoped acceptance, repair ownership, and controller mutation boundaries.
   Acceptance requires a task-scoped commit, independent inspection of its full
   diff, and requested task-level validation evidence before advancing. Separate
   worktrees do not make tasks independent when they edit the same file or one
   relies on another's unmerged code; serialize those tasks. Before dispatching
   a dependent, integrate each accepted prerequisite, check the joined diff for
   textual and semantic conflicts, and rerun affected validation at that exact
   integration head. Do not proceed until those checks pass; an isolated
   prerequisite commit alone is insufficient. For example, dispatch independent
   `API` and `DOC`, integrate their accepted commits, validate their joined head,
   and only then dispatch `WIRE`. Return failed acceptance to the same owner;
   reuse passing checks only when their inputs and environment remain unchanged.
   An accepted item is complete, not assignable again.
3. Report the next action (or no action), evidence, and any acceptance gap. Stop
   before implementation. For an invalid dependency graph, hold dispatch and
   return the specific defects to the plan owner for clarification; do not
   choose which dependency to remove, invent a missing task, or prescribe a
   corrected queue as if that choice were authorized. Separate task-commit
   acceptance from integrated-head acceptance: explicitly require a textual
   and semantic conflict check of the joined diff and rerun affected validation
   at that exact head before accepting the join or dispatching a dependent. If
   an integration changed a validated input, name that rerun as a required
   acceptance action even when an invalid dependency graph also blocks
   dispatch. Calling the earlier report stale does not state the action.

## Implementation mode

Before delegation, read
[the implementation-mode procedure](references/implementation-mode.md)
completely. It is mandatory for implementation mode and owns queue construction,
runtime selection, owner packets, independent acceptance, integration, repairs,
and final validation. Stop when its dependency, task-scoped commit, or
capability gate cannot be satisfied; never implement an item in the controller.

## Runtime mapping

Select an implementation-capable owner and apply the implementation procedure's
capability checks:

| Runtime | Implementation owner |
| --- | --- |
| [Codex](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents) | `worker` |
| [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) | `general-purpose` |
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents) | `general` subagent; `build` is primary |
| [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/coding-agent) | No built-in role; inspect its delegation extension and agent definitions. A bare or non-resumable Pi cannot own an item: stop and report it. |
| Other runtimes | An exposed implementation-capable subagent that passes the checks |

## Finish gate

In `review`, finish only with the non-mutating assessment, evidence, and any
acceptance gap. In `implement`, finish only when every queued item has a
task-scoped, reviewed, verified commit, the final worktree matches the recorded
pre-existing state, and no owner-reported blocker remains. Report the
item-to-commit mapping and final validation; otherwise finish blocked at the
first incomplete gate.
