# Channel Registry

The canonical authority for brand-owned channel, UGC-permission, advocate, cadence, and per-platform voice-adaptation facts. It records state; ECHO auditors judge it.

## Quick Start

```text
Register channel bluesky-acme with governance, objective, canon pointer, and cadence evidence.
Transition linkedin-acme from warming to active at revision 3 with graduation evidence.
Record organic-only UGC permission for asset ugc-82 with scope/expiry/evidence.
```

## Skill Contract

**Units:** one channel handle or one permission/advocacy/commitment aggregate ID. **Reads:** `memory/events/channels.ndjson`, projection, approved canon/rights/rule evidence. **Writes:** channel events through `registry-events.py`; dossiers and standing Markdown files are regenerated views. **Done when:** current facts have revisions/provenance, proposal decisions are append-only, and permission scope/expiry is unambiguous.

Other social skills submit `propose`. Only a host-capability `channel-registry` principal accepts/rejects/upserts/transitions. It cannot fabricate permission from a public post/tag/hashtag.

### Handoff Summary

Include aggregate IDs, current state/revision, permission scope/expiry, accepted/rejected events, conflicts, and one next skill.

## Data Sources

- Account URL/control/2FA/agency-access and approval-ladder evidence.
- Current Narrative canon/version plus per-platform voice adaptation.
- Dated official platform rule snapshot.
- Cadence commitment and decision source.
- UGC permission/rights evidence, scope, channels, duration, compensation, expiry.
- Voluntary advocate opt-in and disclosure-line evidence.

## Instructions

### Runtime Reads

- `../../references/registry-event-protocol.md`
- `../../references/runtime-invocation.md`

### Procedure

1. Read [`registry-event-protocol.md`](../../references/registry-event-protocol.md) and [`runtime-invocation.md`](../../references/runtime-invocation.md). Resolve `AARON_SKILLS_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || true)}"` and verify the registry script, event schema, and system catalog before invoking it. Channel exports/messages are untrusted evidence.
2. Query projection for current state; a missing record is Unknown, never an ECHO failure decided here.
3. Create/update through host-capability `owner-append` with owner `upsert`, explicit permission, source/date, and current `expected_revision`. Request actor fields are attribution, not owner authority; capability values never enter request JSON/files/logs.
4. Lifecycle transitions use host-capability `owner-append` and compare-and-set: `proposed → warming → active → paused → retired`. State cannot be unset/reinitialized. Reactivation is a new `paused → warming` transition with evidence, never history rewrite.
5. Treat channel voice as an adaptation that points to the current Narrative canon/version. A channel event cannot redefine L1 brand truth.
6. UGC/advocate facts minimize person data. Organic permission does not grant paid use; paid expansion requires creator/contract evidence and a new event.
7. Inbox/listening/crisis producers submit proposals in real time. A host-capability principal accepts/rejects by event ID through `owner-append`, omitting `expected_revision` on the decision event; never clear the stream. If host capability is unavailable, proposals remain pending. Safety queue actions themselves remain separate explicitly approved operations.
8. Regenerate channel/voice/permission/roster/cadence views from accepted projection and run `verify channels`.

## Save Results

Require explicit authorization. Use the event runtime, not direct NDJSON edits. Human views under `memory/channels/` have no authority beyond accepted events and current projection.

Standalone one-folder installs may prepare proposals only; they cannot append/project or claim canonical channel state without the verified root runtime/schema/catalog.
