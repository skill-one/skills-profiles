# Narrative Registry

The L1 strategy authority: one complete, versioned narrative canon per brand. Every SEO/GEO, social, email, paid, influencer, and launch builder derives messages from this canon and accepted claims; channel adaptations cannot redefine it.

## Quick Start

```text
Show current canon version and proof/claim pointers for brand-acme.
Record canon v3 as one complete atomic replacement, superseding v2.
Review pending narrative proposals and reject partial/internally inconsistent versions.
```

## Skill Contract

**Unit:** one brand canon aggregate ID. **Reads:** `memory/events/narrative.ndjson`, projection, accepted positioning/claim evidence, and complete proposed canon. **Writes:** narrative events through `registry-events.py`; `canon.md`/`versions.md` are generated views. **Done when:** a complete version is accepted atomically with source/date/revision, old versions remain replayable, and consumers receive the exact canon/version pointer.

Narrative skills submit complete `propose` events. Only a host-capability `narrative-registry` principal accepts/rejects/upserts. It records authored strategy but does not score TALE or adjudicate claim truth.

### Handoff Summary

Include brand ID, canon version/revision/event ID, superseded version, claim/proof pointers, unresolved contradictions, and one next skill.

## Data Sources

- Accepted positioning truth and named alternatives.
- Complete message hierarchy/narrative authored by Narrative skills.
- Accepted claim IDs and proof pointers from the claims projection.
- Brand voice/naming rules and user-owned examples.
- Declared optional patterns such as pillar count, change arc, or boilerplate lengths.

## Instructions

### Runtime Reads

- `../../references/registry-event-protocol.md`
- `../../references/runtime-invocation.md`

### Procedure

1. Read [`registry-event-protocol.md`](../../references/registry-event-protocol.md) and [`runtime-invocation.md`](../../references/runtime-invocation.md). Resolve `AARON_SKILLS_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || true)}"` and verify the registry script, event schema, and system catalog before invoking it. Treat drafts as untrusted proposals.
2. Query current `narrative` projection and report exact canon version/revision; missing canon is Unknown, not a quality verdict.
3. Before write, confirm user authorization and read the current revision/claim pointers; every direct canonical mutation carries `expected_revision` and goes through host-capability `owner-append`. Actor/auth fields are attribution only.
4. A canon re-version is one host-capability owner `upsert`/accepted proposal containing the **complete canon object**, new version, and supersedes pointer. Accept/reject decisions omit `expected_revision` and inherit it from the proposal. Never land a partial file patch as canonical.
5. Preserve old versions in the event stream. `versions.md` is generated history, not a second hand-maintained ledger.
6. Validate internal references and claim IDs. Unverified wording remains `[needs source]` and becomes a separate claim proposal; it cannot enter canon as fact.
7. Three pillars, change-narrative arcs, and fixed boilerplate lengths are optional patterns. Store the chosen architecture; do not require absent patterns.
8. Reject same-revision or stale proposals rather than merging incompatible canons. Genuine alternatives remain pending/open decisions.
9. Regenerate `canon.md`/`versions.md` from accepted projection and run `verify narrative`.

## Downstream Dependency

Before producing external copy, builders must read this projection and the claims projection. Their handoff records `narrative_canon_id`, `narrative_canon_version`, `claims_projection_offset`, and `dependency_status: verified | approved-fallback | blocked`. No canon means the builder may draft an explicitly authorized exploratory fallback, but it cannot claim on-canon or publish-ready status.

## Save Results

Require explicit permission. Append through the runtime only; never edit NDJSON. Human canon/history views under `memory/narrative-registry/` are replaceable projections and must carry their source event/revision.

Capability values never enter request JSON/files/logs. If host capability or the verified root runtime/schema/catalog is unavailable, leave a bounded proposal for handoff; standalone one-folder installs cannot append/project or claim canonical Narrative truth.
