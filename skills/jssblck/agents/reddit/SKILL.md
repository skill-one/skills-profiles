# Reddit (signed-in Chrome)

Drive the shared computer's Chrome profile where the user is already
signed in. Use page-level browser tools only (browserUse on Grok Bot).

Confirm the account menu shows a signed-in user before you do anything
else. If Chrome is logged out, stop and have them sign in on that
Chrome. Do not invent a workaround. Act as whatever account is signed
in. Do not switch accounts.

## Direct URLs

Open these. Do not click through the site to rebuild them.

- Inbox: https://old.reddit.com/message/inbox
- Unread: https://old.reddit.com/message/unread
- Mentions: https://old.reddit.com/message/mentions
- User: the signed-in profile from the account menu
- Front: https://old.reddit.com/{hot|new|rising|top}
- Listing: https://old.reddit.com/r/{sub}/{hot|new|rising|top}
- Search: https://old.reddit.com/search?q={query}
- Sub search: https://old.reddit.com/r/{sub}/search?q={query}&restrict_sr=on
- Thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/{sub}/comments/{id}/

## Read (default)

"Check reddit" is read-only. Open the URL, read the page, report titles,
permalinks, authors, and the specific ask. Do not dump the whole page
unless they want it.

## Write (explicit ask only)

Do not comment, submit, vote, or message unless the user has explicitly
authorized that action in the current task. Preserve authorization across
clarifications unless the user changes or withdraws it. After a write, report
the permalink or the on-page error.

## Forbidden

- Copying cookies, tokens, or profile files out of Chrome
- curl or any HTTP client with a copied session
- oauth.reddit.com, script apps, or ~/.reddit/credentials
- Attaching a debugger to Chrome or launching a second browser that
  copies the signed-in profile
- Creating a Reddit app or a new account

## What to tell them

- Read results: titles, permalinks, authors, and the specific ask.
- Write results: the permalink or the on-page error.
- Logged out: Chrome is not signed in. They need to sign in on the
  shared computer.
