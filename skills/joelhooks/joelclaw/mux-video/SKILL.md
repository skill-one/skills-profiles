# mux-video (RETIRED)

**This pipeline was retired 2026-07-15.** Video publishing is now fully Cloudflare-native
through wzrrd — see `skills/wzrrd-video/SKILL.md`. Existing Mux assets keep playing; use the
Mux API directly (credentials in agent-secrets: `mux_token_id`/`mux_token_secret`) only for
managing those historical assets. The Mux webhook registration at hooks.joelclaw.com is
vestigial (events verify and are dropped).
