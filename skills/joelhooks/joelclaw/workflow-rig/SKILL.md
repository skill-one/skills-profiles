# Workflow Rig

Use this skill as the **canonical front door** for agent-driven work in joelclaw.

The user should not have to choose between `agent-workloads`, `restate-workflows`, queue internals, or runtime trivia.

If the user says the magic words —
- "run this through the workflow rig"
- "dogfood this with the workflow rig"
- "kick this off"
- "start a canary"
- "run this as a workload"

— load this skill first.

## What this skill owns

- workload shaping (`serial`, `parallel`, `chained`)
- choosing between inline work, durable runtime, or a pure handoff
- `joelclaw workload plan` / `dispatch` / `run`
- explicit stage DAGs via `--stages-from`
- honest runtime truth: what the restate-worker can do today, and what it still cannot do
- verification contracts before runtime fan-out
- canary/dogfood posture for real workload proofs

## Core rule

**Intent first, substrate second.**

The caller describes the work.
The workflow rig chooses the narrowest honest execution path.

**Verification first, loops second.** Before planning durable or parallel runtime work, ask: can an agent prove this worked without Joel staring at it? If not, shape a verification/tooling stage first. Do not turn unverified vibes into high-throughput slop.

Do not push Redis vs Restate vs sandbox trivia back onto the caller unless that tradeoff is the actual decision.

## Current proven state (as of 2026-03-17, session StubbornFerret)

- `joelclaw workload plan`, `joelclaw workload dispatch`, and `joelclaw workload run` are real.
- Proven durable path: `joelclaw workload plan` → Redis queue → Restate `dagOrchestrator` → `dagWorker` → execution.
- Multi-stage DAGs with `dependsOn` are proven across 3-5 stage pipelines. Downstream stages can consume earlier outputs via `{{nodeId}}` interpolation.
- `--stages-from stages.json` is proven: duplicate ids, unknown deps, self-deps, and cycles are rejected before runtime admission; critical path and phase grouping are calculated.
- `shell` handler ✅ runs commands in the k8s `restate-worker` pod. Git clone, pi agent file writes, git commit, and git push are proven.
- `infer` handler ✅ **full pi agent with tools** — read, edit, write, bash. `pi -p` mode enables all tools. It can read files, edit them, run commands, and produce working code changes. Not just text generation — full agent-style codegen.
- `microvm` handler ⏸️ code works (one-shot exec model proven via bun test in pod) but ADR-0230 is **paused** — Colima nestedVirtualization crashes the VM under load. Don't use.
- The `restate-worker` image is a full agent environment: pi 0.58.4, 76 skills, GitHub push auth from k8s secret, pi auth mounted from host (stays fresh).
- Autonomous codegen proven: infer handler reads files + edits them via pi tools. Shell handler handles git clone/commit/push. Chain them in a DAG for full autonomous coding loops.
- Pre-cloned repo cache at `/app/repo-cache` (~200ms copy vs ~3s clone). `dagWorker` uses 15m inactivity timeout and 30m hard abort.
- Retry caps: dagWorker maxAttempts=5, dagOrchestrator maxAttempts=3. No more infinite retry poisoning.

## What does not work yet

- `microvm` handler paused (ADR-0230) — needs dedicated Linux hardware with native KVM
- DAG completion notifications to the gateway not wired (operators poll or check OTEL)
- large-file pi agent edits can be slow (3-5 minutes) but succeed within the 15m timeout

## Canonical operator flow

1. Shape the work with `joelclaw workload plan`, including the verification contract for every stage.
2. Present the shaped workload and verification path. Use existing authorization for a scoped run request; ask only for missing consequential choices or additional scope.
3. Within the authorized scope:
   - execute inline if it is bounded, local, and reversible
   - use `joelclaw workload run` for real durable execution
   - use `joelclaw workload dispatch` only for a real baton pass
4. If you enqueue runtime work, poll for progress with `joelclaw runs`, `joelclaw run <run-id>`, or OTEL. There is no automatic completion ping yet.
5. Report outcome tersely: changed, verified, remaining, next move

If the proof path is missing, stop before runtime admission and author the reusable verifier skill/tool/check first. That is the leverage move.

## Magic words → canonical commands

### Plan only
```bash
joelclaw workload plan "<intent>" --repo <repo> [--paths a,b,c] [--stages-from <path>] [--write-plan <path>]
```

### Real runtime canary / dogfood
```bash
joelclaw workload run <plan-artifact> \
  [--stage <stage-id>] \
  [--tool pi|codex|claude] \
  [--timeout <seconds>] \
  [--model <model>] \
  [--execution-mode auto|host|sandbox] \
  [--sandbox-backend local|k8s] \
  [--sandbox-mode minimal|full] \
  [--repo-url <git-url>] \
  [--dry-run] \
  [--skip-dep-check]
```

### Handoff, not execution
```bash
joelclaw workload dispatch <plan-artifact> \
  [--stage <stage-id>] \
  [--project <mail-project>] \
  [--from <agent>] \
  [--to <agent>] \
  [--send-mail] \
  [--write-dispatch <path>]
```

## Sandbox mode guidance

Use `--sandbox-mode full` when the proof needs real runtime surfaces:
- service/network lifecycle
- full environment materialization
- cleanup evidence
- anything where a minimal local sandbox would hide the real failure mode

Use `--sandbox-mode minimal` for cheap code/doc/test slices where full runtime provisioning is overkill.

Use `--stages-from` when you already have a real stage DAG. The planner preserves per-stage acceptance, validates dependencies/cycles, calculates critical path metadata, and keeps the DAG instead of collapsing it into template stages.

Use `--skip-dep-check` only for deliberate manual recovery. Normal `joelclaw workload run` blocks a stage until its explicit dependencies have terminal truth.

Do **not** use `microvm` — ADR-0230 is paused. Colima nestedVirtualization is unstable. Use `shell` + `infer` for all work.

## Current runtime truth

- `joelclaw workload run` is the real bridge from workload artifacts to runtime admission.
- The durable path is Redis queue admission → Restate `dagOrchestrator` → `dagWorker`.
- `dagOrchestrator` resolves dependency waves correctly for chained multi-stage DAGs.
- `{{nodeId}}` interpolation is proven for passing upstream outputs into downstream stages.
- The `shell` handler is the proven path for git operations (clone, commit, push) and arbitrary CLI work.
- The `infer` handler is a **full pi agent** — it reads, edits, and writes files via tools. Use it for codegen, analysis, and any task that benefits from LLM + file access.
- Chain `infer` (edit files) → `shell` (git commit + push) for autonomous coding loops.
- The `microvm` handler is paused (ADR-0230). Do not use.
- Completion is poll-based for now. No gateway finish event is emitted when a DAG lands.

## Real chained example

This is an honest four-stage shape the rig can run today:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "research",
    "name": "Research current state",
    "acceptance": ["Facts gathered"],
    "executionMode": "manual"
  },
  {
    "id": "plan",
    "name": "Turn research into an execution plan",
    "dependsOn": ["research"],
    "acceptance": ["Implementation plan written"],
    "executionMode": "manual"
  },
  {
    "id": "implement",
    "name": "Apply the change in the worker",
    "dependsOn": ["plan"],
    "acceptance": ["Requested files updated", "Commit pushed"],
    "executionMode": "pi",
    "notes": "Use {{plan}} as the downstream input."
  },
  {
    "id": "verify",
    "name": "Verify and summarize",
    "dependsOn": ["implement"],
    "acceptance": ["Exact proof command/artifact captured", "Quality bar checked", "Closeout ready"],
    "executionMode": "manual",
    "notes": "Use {{implement}} for verification context. If this cannot be proven by an agent, split out a verifier skill/tool stage before implementation."
  }
]
```

Run it through the front door:

```bash
joelclaw workload plan "Research, plan, implement, then verify the change" \
  --repo ~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw \
  --stages-from stages.json \
  --write-plan plan.json
```

## When to reach for compatibility skills

- `agent-workloads` — only when an older prompt already names it; treat it as a compatibility alias
- `restate-workflows` — only when the work is specifically about external-repo runtime bridging or low-level substrate contracts

## Dogfood posture

When proving runtime work:
- prefer a canary first
- use the real front door (`joelclaw workload run`), not hand-rolled `system/agent.requested`, unless you are debugging below the rig
- capture honest evidence from queue admission, Restate, `dagWorker`, and resulting git/verification artifacts
- poll the run yourself; there is no completion event to the gateway yet
- inside a sandboxed stage run, do **not** launch another workflow-rig canary
- if the rig is broken, say the rig is broken; do not blame sandboxes or the gateway for a queue/worker failure
- if the task needs large-file agent edits, budget minutes, not seconds

## Rules

- do not invent new workload vocabulary when `docs/workloads.md` already defines it
- do not force the operator to choose queue vs Restate vs sandbox when `joelclaw workload run` is the right bridge
- do not use `microvm` — ADR-0230 paused
- do not claim a dogfood proof succeeded unless the real runtime path moved and produced evidence
- do not imply automatic completion notifications exist when they do not
