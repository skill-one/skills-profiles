# Slack Link Context

A Slack message permalink in Joel's prompt is executable context.

## Procedure

1. Run this before reasoning, summarizing, or asking questions:

   ```bash
   jc-slack context '<permalink>'
   ```

2. Use the returned bounded JSON as the source.
3. If Joel pasted only the link, report the message, useful thread context, and likely request.
4. If the message contains a work request, follow Joel's prompt and fleet work-tagging rules.
5. If Joel explicitly asks to reply, post, send, or respond in that Slack thread:
   - write the exact reply to a temporary text file
   - run `jc-slack reply '<permalink>' --text-file <path>` to get the approval-bound preview
   - after Joel approves that preview, run its exact `next_actions[0].command`; it carries the text hash, stable request ID, and `--confirm-send`
   - report the returned gateway flow and Slack message receipt

Without explicit send approval, draft the reply and stop. Do not turn a direct send request into “paste-ready text” for Joel to shuttle manually.

## Rules

- Do not ask Joel to paste the Slack text.
- Do not open Slack in a browser.
- Do not call Slack with `curl`.
- Do not lease or print a Slack token. `jc-slack` owns authentication.
- `jc-slack context` is read-only. Do not react or post unless Joel's request or fleet rules require it.
- `jc-slack reply` previews by default. Send only with the exact confirmation command from that preview; it uses the single gateway transport.
- Never claim Slack posting is impossible before checking `jc-slack reply --help`.
- If `jc-slack` is absent or cannot run, report that exact capability gap. Do not call the link unreadable.
