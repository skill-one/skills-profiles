# k8s Cluster Operations — joelclaw on Talos

## Architecture

```
Mac Mini (localhost ports)
  └─ Colima/Lima port forwarding (grpc for host-published service ports; avoid separate persistent autossh tunnels)
      └─ Colima VM (8 CPU, 24 GiB, 100 GiB, VZ framework, aarch64)
          └─ Docker 29.x + buildx (joelclaw-builder, docker-container driver)
              └─ Talos v1.12.4 container (joelclaw-controlplane-1, 18 GiB cap)
                  └─ k8s v1.35.0 (single node, Flannel CNI)
                      └─ joelclaw namespace (privileged PSA)
```

**⚠️ Talos has NO shell.** No bash, no /bin/sh, nothing. You cannot `docker exec` into the Talos container. Use `talosctl` for node operations and the Colima VM (`ssh lima-colima`) for host-level operations like `modprobe`.

### Colima Stability Rules (2026-03-17 incident)

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| CPU | 8 | Match k8s workload requests (~2.8 CPU, 72%) |
| Memory | 24 GiB | Current post-reboot profile; 16 GiB left too little headroom once the Talos container cap is raised. Re-evaluate if macOS memory pressure returns. |
| nestedVirtualization | **OFF by default** | Crashes VM under load (image builds, heavy scheduling). Toggle ON only for Firecracker testing |
| vmType | vz | Required for Apple Silicon |
| mountType | virtiofs | Fastest option with VZ |

**`nestedVirtualization: true` is unstable on M4 Pro under load.** It causes the Colima VM to silently crash during Docker builds/pushes. Each crash:
- Kills the Talos container mid-operation
- Corrupts Redis AOF (if caught mid-write) → crash-loop on restart
- Breaks Lima socket forwarding → `docker` CLI on macOS disconnects
- Creates stale k8s pods that re-pull images → amplifies pressure

**Recovery from Colima crash-loop:**
1. `colima stop && colima start` — basic restart
2. If Redis crash-loops: `redis-check-aof --fix` (see Redis AOF Recovery below)
3. If Restate has stuck invocations: purge PVC or kill via admin API
4. If native Docker socket dead: use SSH tunnel `ssh -L /tmp/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`

**Docker image builds** should use the buildx container builder (`docker buildx build --builder joelclaw-builder`) to isolate build IO from k8s workloads.

### Redis AOF Recovery

If Redis crash-loops after a VM restart with `Bad file format reading the append only file`:
```bash
# 1. Scale down Redis (or use a temp pod if StatefulSet can't mount PVC concurrently)
kubectl -n joelclaw apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis-fix
  namespace: joelclaw
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
      operator: Exists
      effect: NoSchedule
  containers:
    - name: fix
      image: redis:7-alpine
      command: ["sh", "-c", "cd /data/appendonlydir && echo y | redis-check-aof --fix *.incr.aof && redis-check-aof *.incr.aof"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /data
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
    - name: data
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: data-redis-0
EOF
# 2. Wait, check logs, then clean up
kubectl -n joelclaw logs redis-fix
kubectl -n joelclaw delete pod redis-fix --force
# 3. Restart Redis
kubectl -n joelclaw delete pod redis-0
```

For port mappings, recovery procedures, and cluster recreation steps, read [references/operations.md](references/operations.md).

### Reboot-heal persistence rule (2026-04-15 incident)

`infra/k8s-reboot-heal.sh` runs under launchd as a fresh process every interval. Any recovery marker that only lives in shell memory dies at the end of that tick.

That means flannel/event-healing state must be persisted on disk. Canonical path:

```bash
~/.local/state/k8s-reboot-heal.env
```

Persist at least:
- `COLIMA_START_EPOCH`
- `RECOVERY_START_EPOCH`
- `LAST_FLANNEL_RESTART_EPOCH`
- `COLIMA_UNHEALTHY_STREAK`
- `LAST_COLIMA_UNHEALTHY_EPOCH`
- `LAST_COLIMA_FORCE_CYCLE_EPOCH`
- `LAST_COLIMA_FAILED_RECOVERY_EPOCH`

Why this matters: kubelet `FailedCreatePodSandBox` events mentioning missing `subnet.env` can stay recent for minutes after the first repair. If the healer forgets that it already restarted flannel, the next launchd tick can bounce flannel again and knock healthy services like Typesense back into 503 warmup for no good reason. The extra failed-recovery marker also stops the system from counting a one-minute green flash as success and then force-cycling Colima again when the control path collapses.

### Kubeconfig / Talos Endpoint Contract (2026-05-30 incident)

Current operator access uses Colima/Lima's directly published TCP ports:

- Kubernetes API: `https://127.0.0.1:6443`
- Talos API: `127.0.0.1:50000`

Do **not** rewrite kubeconfig/Talos back to the older manual tunnel ports (`16443` / `15000`) unless explicitly testing `KUBE_OPERATOR_MODE=ssh`. After the 2026-05-30 reboot, `grpc` publishing kept service ports open but could leave Colima SSH and the Docker socket dead after load; a live `ssh` port-forwarder test did the opposite and dropped the service ports. The current availability-first default remains Colima `portForwarder: grpc`, but completion audits must verify both service ports and Docker/limactl instead of trusting either mode by vibes.

**Fix/verify**:
```bash
talosctl config endpoint 127.0.0.1:50000
talosctl config node 10.5.0.2
kubectl config set-cluster joelclaw --server=https://127.0.0.1:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
kubectl config use-context admin@joelclaw
kubectl get nodes --request-timeout=10s
talosctl -e 127.0.0.1:50000 -n 10.5.0.2 version --client=false
```

`infra/kube-operator-access.sh` now defaults to `KUBE_OPERATOR_MODE=direct` and runs as a boring launchd monitor that keeps configs pointed at `6443` / `50000`. It still has an `ssh` mode for deliberate fallback testing.

### Durable recovery rule (ADR-0244)

A Colima restart is **not** recovery.

After any `colima start` / force-cycle, the system only counts recovery as real if a post-restart stability window stays healthy across repeated passes for:
- Colima SSH
- Docker socket
- Kubernetes API
- Typesense localhost health
- Inngest localhost health

If those regress during the verification window, classify the event as a **failed recovery**, capture proof artifacts, and stop repeated force-cycles for the configured hold period. The point is durability, not healer theatre.

## Quick Health Check

```bash
kubectl get pods -n joelclaw                          # all pods
curl -s localhost:3111/api/inngest                     # system-bus-worker → 200
curl -s localhost:7880/                                # LiveKit → "OK"
curl -s localhost:8108/health                          # Typesense → {"ok":true}
curl -s localhost:8288/health                          # Inngest → {"status":200}
curl -s localhost:9070/deployments                     # Restate admin → deployments list
curl -s localhost:9627/xrpc/_health                    # PDS → {"version":"..."}
kubectl exec -n joelclaw redis-0 -- redis-cli ping     # → PONG
joelclaw restate cron status                           # Dkron scheduler → healthy via temporary CLI tunnel
```

### Restate / Firecracker runtime notes

- `deployment/restate-worker` is intentionally **privileged** and mounts `/dev/kvm` (hostPath type `""` — optional).
- PVC `firecracker-images` at `/tmp/firecracker-test` stores kernel, rootfs, and snapshot artifacts.
- When `nestedVirtualization` is OFF: `/dev/kvm` absent, `microvm` DAG handler fails, but `shell`/`infer`/`noop` handlers work normally.
- When `nestedVirtualization` is ON: Firecracker one-shot exec works (create workspace ext4 → write command → boot VM → guest executes → poweroff → read results).
- **Restate retry caps**: dagWorker maxAttempts=5, dagOrchestrator maxAttempts=3. Prevents journal poisoning.
- **Stuck Restate invocations**: Inspect and target the affected invocation through supported APIs. Journal or PVC destruction requires separate explicit data-loss authorization and a verified backup; never use it as a routine stuck-job fix.
- Re-register worker: `curl -X POST http://localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri":"http://restate-worker:9080"}'`

**⚠️ PDS port trap**: Docker maps `9627→3000` (host→container). NodePort must be **3000** to match the container-side port. If set to 9627, traffic won't route.

**Rule**: NodePort value = Docker's container-side port, not host-side.

## Agent Runner (Cold k8s Jobs)

**Status**: local sandbox remains the default/live path; the k8s backend is now code-landed and opt-in, but still needs supervised rollout before calling it earned runtime.

The agent runner executes sandboxed story runs as isolated k8s Jobs. Jobs are created dynamically via `@joelclaw/agent-execution/job-spec` — no static manifests.

### Runtime Image Contract

See `k8s/agent-runner.yaml` for the full specification.

Required components:
- Git (checkout, diff, commit)
- Bun runtime
- runner-installed agent tooling (currently `claude` and/or other installed CLIs)
- `/workspace` working directory
- runtime entrypoint at `/app/packages/agent-execution/src/job-runner.ts`

Configuration via environment variables:
- Request metadata: `WORKFLOW_ID`, `REQUEST_ID`, `STORY_ID`, `SANDBOX_PROFILE`, `BASE_SHA`, `EXECUTION_BACKEND`, `JOB_NAME`, `JOB_NAMESPACE`
- Repo materialization: `REPO_URL`, `REPO_BRANCH`, optional `HOST_REQUESTED_CWD`
- Agent identity: `AGENT_NAME`, `AGENT_MODEL`, `AGENT_VARIANT`, `AGENT_PROGRAM`
- Execution config: `SESSION_ID`, `TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- Task prompt: `TASK_PROMPT_B64` (base64-encoded)
- Verification: `VERIFICATION_COMMANDS_B64` (base64-encoded JSON array)
- Callback path: `RESULT_CALLBACK_URL`, `RESULT_CALLBACK_TOKEN`

Expected behavior:
1. Decode task from `TASK_PROMPT_B64`
2. Materialize repo from `REPO_URL` / `REPO_BRANCH` at `BASE_SHA`
3. Execute the requested `AGENT_PROGRAM`
4. Run verification commands (if set)
5. Print `SandboxExecutionResult` markers to stdout and POST the same result to `/internal/agent-result`
6. Exit 0 (success) or non-zero (failure)

Current truthful limit:
- `pi` remains local-backend only for now; do not pretend the pod runner can execute pi story runs yet.

### Job Lifecycle

```typescript
import { generateJobSpec, generateJobDeletion } from "@joelclaw/agent-execution";

// 1. Generate Job spec
const spec = generateJobSpec(request, {
  runtime: {
    image: "ghcr.io/joelhooks/agent-runner:latest",
    imagePullPolicy: "Always",
    command: ["bun", "run", "/app/packages/agent-execution/src/job-runner.ts"],
  },
  namespace: "joelclaw",
  imagePullSecret: "ghcr-pull",
  resultCallbackUrl: "http://host.docker.internal:3111/internal/agent-result",
  resultCallbackToken: process.env.OTEL_EMIT_TOKEN,
});

// 2. Apply to cluster (via kubectl or k8s client library)
// 3. Job runs → Pod materializes repo, executes agent, posts SandboxExecutionResult callback
// 4. Host worker can recover the same terminal result from log markers if callback delivery fails
// 5. Job auto-deletes after TTL (default: 5 minutes)

// Cancel a running Job
const deletion = generateJobDeletion("req-xyz");
// kubectl delete job ${deletion.name} -n ${deletion.namespace}
```

### Resource Defaults

- CPU: `500m` request, `2` limit
- Memory: `1Gi` request, `4Gi` limit
- Active deadline: `1 hour`
- TTL after completion: `5 minutes`
- Backoff limit: `0` (no retries)

### Security

- Non-root execution (UID 1000, GID 1000)
- No privilege escalation
- All capabilities dropped
- RuntimeDefault seccomp profile
- Control plane toleration for single-node cluster

### Verification Commands

```bash
# List agent runner Jobs
kubectl get jobs -n joelclaw -l app.kubernetes.io/name=agent-runner

# Check Job status
kubectl describe job <job-name> -n joelclaw

# View logs
kubectl logs job/<job-name> -n joelclaw

# Check for stale Jobs (should be auto-deleted by TTL)
kubectl get jobs -n joelclaw --show-all
```

### Current State

- ✅ Job spec generator (`packages/agent-execution/src/job-spec.ts`)
- ✅ Runtime contract (`k8s/agent-runner.yaml`)
- ✅ Tests (`packages/agent-execution/__tests__/job-spec.test.ts`)
- ⏳ Runtime image not yet built (Story 3)
- ⏳ Hot-image CronJob not yet implemented (Story 4)
- ⏳ Warm-pool scheduler not yet implemented (Story 5)
- ⏳ Restate integration not yet wired (Story 6)

## NAS NFS Access from k8s (ADR-0088 Phase 2.5)

k8s pods can mount NAS storage over NFS via a LAN route through the Colima bridge.

### How it works

```
k8s pod → Talos container (10.5.0.x) → Docker NAT → Colima VM
  → ip route 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.64.1 dev col0
  → macOS host (IP forwarding enabled) → LAN → NAS (192.168.1.163)
```

**Root cause of prior failures:** VZ framework's shared networking on eth0 doesn't properly forward LAN-bound traffic. The fix routes LAN traffic through col0 (Colima bridge → macOS host) instead.

### Route persistence

The LAN route is set in **two places** for reliability:
1. **Colima provision script** (`~/.colima/default/colima.yaml`) — runs on `colima start` (cold boot)
2. **k8s-reboot-heal** (`~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/infra/k8s-reboot-heal.sh`) — reasserts the route during reboot recovery ticks

Both execute: `ip route replace 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.64.1 dev col0`

### Duplicate tunnel ownership is a bug (2026-04-16)

`com.joel.colima-tunnel` is deprecated. Colima/Lima already forwards the docker-published host ports for `joelclaw-controlplane-1`, so a second autossh daemon on those same ports is not redundancy — it's interference.

Rules:
- `com.joel.colima` is the only boot/start helper for the VM; it must not keep a periodic `StartInterval`
- `com.joel.colima-tunnel` should be absent from `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`; `install-critical-launchdaemons.sh` removes it instead of reinstalling it
- do not run a second autossh daemon on ports Colima/Lima already publishes for `joelclaw-controlplane-1` (`3838`, `6379`, `7880`, `7881`, `8108`, `8288`, `8289`, `9627`, `64784`)
- do not kill generic `ssh` listeners on those host ports; that can kill Lima's own forwarders
- `infra/colima-tunnel.sh` is now only a deprecated compatibility stub so stale launchd installs exit cleanly instead of fighting Lima
- `com.joel.kube-operator-access` is now a direct-mode monitor, not a persistent tunnel. It keeps kubectl/talosctl aimed at Colima/Lima's published loopback ports: `6443` for kube-apiserver and `50000` for Talos
- the old SSH tunnel mode (`16443 -> 10.5.0.2:6443`, `15000 -> 10.5.0.2:50000`) is fallback-only via `KUBE_OPERATOR_MODE=ssh`; do not leave it crash-looping under launchd
- once the daemon is installed, kubectl should use `https://127.0.0.1:6443` and talosctl should use `127.0.0.1:50000`
- `com.joel.k8s-reboot-heal` must use the same JSON status check; a plain `colima status` false-negative can force-cycle the VM and retrigger the flannel/NAS failure cascade during reboot recovery
- do not trust status output alone when deciding to cycle Colima; if the Docker socket or Colima SSH path is still healthy, treat the VM as alive and keep your hands off it
- a Colima force-cycle now requires confirmed evidence; one ugly observation is not enough to panic-cycle the VM
- confirmation can come from consecutive launchd ticks or from a short rapid-confirmation window when both the Docker socket and Colima SSH path stay down long enough to prove a severe collapse
- after any Colima force-cycle, honor the persisted cooldown in `~/.local/state/k8s-reboot-heal.env` so Talos and workload warmup can finish before another escalation is even considered
- if the host path is still down but escalation is not yet earned, bail out early and mark the tick failed; do not pretend downstream kube/NAS repair steps are actionable without Colima host access
- reboot recovery is not healthy until the NAS route `192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.64.1 dev col0` exists again and NFS is reachable from the Colima VM
- flannel can be "Running" while kubelet still reports `failed to load flannel 'subnet.env' file`; treat recent `FailedCreatePodSandBox` events with that message as a restart signal for the flannel pod

### Available PVs

| PV | NFS Path | Capacity | Access | Use |
|----|----------|----------|--------|-----|
| `nas-nvme` | `192.168.1.163:/volume2/data` | 1.5TB | RWX | NVMe RAID1: backups, snapshots, models, sessions |
| `nas-hdd` | `192.168.1.163:/volume1/joelclaw` | 50TB | RWX | HDD RAID5: books, docs-artifacts, archives, otel |
| `minio-nfs-pv` | `192.168.1.163:/volume1/joelclaw` | 1TB | RWO | HDD tier: MinIO object storage (same export) |

### Mounting NAS in a pod

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: nas
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: nas-nvme
containers:
  - volumeMounts:
      - name: nas
        mountPath: /nas
        # Optional: subPath for specific dir
        subPath: typesense
```

### Rules

- **Always use IP (192.168.1.163), never hostname (three-body).** DNS doesn't resolve from inside k8s.
- **Always use `nfsvers=3,tcp,resvport,noatime`** mount options. NFSv4 has issues with Asustor ADM.
- **NAS unavailability degrades gracefully** with `soft` mount option — returns errors, doesn't hang pods.
- **NFS write performance: ~660 MiB/s** over 10GbE with jumbo frames. Good for sequential I/O (backups, snapshots). Latency-sensitive workloads (Redis, active Typesense indexes) stay on local SSD.
- **If NFS mount fails after Colima restart:** verify the route exists: `colima ssh -- ip route | grep 192.168.1.0`

### Verify connectivity

```bash
# From Colima VM
colima ssh -- timeout 2 bash -c "echo > /dev/tcp/192.168.1.163/2049" && echo "NFS OK"

# From k8s pod
kubectl run nfs-test --image=busybox --restart=Never -n joelclaw \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"tolerations":[{"key":"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane","operator":"Exists","effect":"NoSchedule"}],"containers":[{"name":"t","image":"busybox","command":["sh","-c","ls /nas && echo OK"],"volumeMounts":[{"name":"n","mountPath":"/nas"}]}],"volumes":[{"name":"n","persistentVolumeClaim":{"claimName":"nas-nvme"}}]}}'
kubectl logs nfs-test -n joelclaw && kubectl delete pod nfs-test -n joelclaw --force
```

## Auto Deploy (GitHub Actions)

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/system-bus-worker-deploy.yml`
- Trigger: push to `main` touching `packages/system-bus/**` or worker deploy files
- Behavior:
  - builds/pushes `ghcr.io/joelhooks/system-bus-worker:${GITHUB_SHA}` + `:latest`
  - runs deploy job on `self-hosted` runner
  - updates k8s deployment image + waits for rollout + probes worker health
- If deploy job is queued forever, check that a `self-hosted` runner is online on the Mac Mini.

### GHCR push 403 Forbidden

**Cause:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` (default Actions token) does not have `packages:write` scope for this repo. A dedicated PAT is required.

**Fix already applied:** Workflow uses `secrets.GHCR_PAT` (not `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`) for the GHCR login step. The PAT is stored in:
- GitHub repo secrets as `GHCR_PAT` (set via GitHub UI)
- agent-secrets as `ghcr_pat` (`secrets lease ghcr_pat`)

**If this breaks again:** PAT may have expired. Regenerate at github.com → Settings → Developer settings → PATs, update both stores.

**Local fallback (bypass GHA entirely):**
```bash
DOCKER_CONFIG_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
echo '{"credsStore":""}' > "$DOCKER_CONFIG_DIR/config.json"
export DOCKER_CONFIG="$DOCKER_CONFIG_DIR"
secrets lease ghcr_pat | docker login ghcr.io -u joelhooks --password-stdin
~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/k8s/publish-system-bus-worker.sh
```
Note: `publish-system-bus-worker.sh` uses `gh auth token` internally — if `gh auth` is stale, use the Docker login above before running the script, or patch it to use `secrets lease ghcr_pat` directly.

## Resilience Rules (ADR-0148)

1. **NEVER use `kubectl port-forward` for persistent service exposure.** All long-lived operator surfaces MUST use NodePort + Docker port mappings. The narrow exception is a CLI-managed, short-lived tunnel for an otherwise in-cluster-only control surface (for example `joelclaw restate cron *` tunneling to `dkron-svc`). Port-forwards silently die on idle/restart/pod changes, so do not leave them running.
2. **All workloads MUST have liveness + readiness + startup probes.** Missing probes = silent hangs that never recover.
3. **After any Docker/Colima/node restart**: remove control-plane taint, **uncordon node**, verify flannel, check all pods reach Running.
4. **PVC reclaimPolicy is Delete** — deleting a PVC = permanent data loss. Never delete PVCs without backup.
5. **`firecracker-images` is stateful runtime data.** Treat it like a real runtime PVC: kernel, rootfs, and snapshot loss will break the microVM path.
6. **Colima VM disk is limited (19GB).** Monitor with `colima ssh -- df -h /`. Alert at >80%.
7. **All launchd plists MUST set PATH including `/opt/homebrew/bin`.** Colima shells to `limactl`, kubectl/talosctl live in homebrew. launchd's default PATH is `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` — no homebrew. The canonical PATH for infra plists is: `/opt/homebrew/bin:/Users/joel/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`. Discovered Feb 2026: missing PATH caused 6 days of silent recovery failures.
8. **Shell scripts run by launchd MUST export PATH at the top.** Even if the plist sets EnvironmentVariables, belt-and-suspenders — add `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:..."` to the script itself.

### Current Probe Gaps (fix when touching these services)
- Typesense: missing liveness probe (hangs won't be detected)
- Bluesky PDS: missing readiness and startup probes
- system-bus-worker: missing startup probe

## Danger Zones

1. **Stale SSH mux socket after Colima restart** — When Colima restarts (disk resize, crash recovery, `colima stop && start`), the SSH port changes but the mux socket (`~/.colima/_lima/colima/ssh.sock`) caches the old connection. Symptoms: `kubectl port-forward` fails with "tls: internal error", `kubectl get nodes` may intermittently work then fail. **Fix**: the owning service’s scoped recovery command after identifying the exact affected process; never kill SSH processes by name, then re-establish tunnels with `ssh -o ControlPath=none`. Always verify SSH port with `colima ssh-config | grep Port` after restart.
2. **Adding Docker port mappings** — can be hot-added without cluster recreation via `hostconfig.json` edit. See [references/operations.md](references/operations.md) for the procedure.
3. **Inngest legacy host alias in manifests** — old container-host alias may still appear in legacy configs. Worker uses connect mode, so it usually still works, but prefer explicit Talos/Colima hostnames.
4. **Colima zombie state** — `colima status` reports "Running" but docker socket / SSH tunnels are dead. All k8s ports unresponsive. `colima start` is a no-op. Only `colima restart` recovers. Detect with: `ssh -F ~/.colima/_lima/colima/ssh.config lima-colima "docker info"` — if that fails while `colima status` passes, it's a zombie. The heal script handles this automatically.
5. **Talos container has NO shell** — No bash, no /bin/sh. Cannot `docker exec` into it. Kernel modules like `br_netfilter` must be loaded at the Colima VM level: `ssh lima-colima "sudo modprobe br_netfilter"`.
6. **AIStor service-name collision** — if AIStor objectstore is deployed in `joelclaw`, it can claim `svc/minio` and break legacy MinIO assumptions. Keep AIStor objectstore in isolated namespace (`aistor`) unless intentionally cutting over.
7. **AIStor operator webhook SSA conflict** — repeated `helm upgrade` can fail on `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` `caBundle` ownership conflict. Current mitigation in this cluster: set `operators.object-store.webhook.enabled=false` in `k8s/aistor-operator-values.yaml`.
8. **MinIO pinned tag trap** — `minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z` is not available on Docker Hub in this environment (ErrImagePull). Legacy fallback currently relies on `minio/minio:latest`.
9. **`restate-worker` privilege is intentional.** Do not “harden” away `/dev/kvm`, `privileged: true`, or the unconfined seccomp profile unless you are simultaneously changing the Firecracker runtime contract.
10. **Dkron service-name collision** — never create a bare `svc/dkron`. Kubernetes injects `DKRON_*` env vars into pods, which collides with Dkron's own config parsing. Use `dkron-peer` and `dkron-svc`.
11. **Dkron PVC permissions** — upstream `dkron/dkron:latest` currently needs root on the local-path PVC. Non-root hardening caused `permission denied` under `/data/raft/snapshots/permTest` and CrashLoopBackOff.
12. **Typesense host access must be a real service contract** — after the 2026-04-19 rebuild, OTEL emit hung because host code still targeted `localhost:8108` while `typesense` had been restored as `ClusterIP` only. The fix was to make `k8s/typesense.yaml` a NodePort service on `8108` again so host worker + CLI writes have a stable path without reviving a launchd port-forward sidecar.
13. **docs-api restore also needs `docs-api-env`** — the manifest depends on secret `docs-api-env` with key `PDF_BRAIN_API_TOKEN`. The token lives in agent-secrets as `pdf_brain_api_token`; recreate the k8s secret before applying `k8s/docs-api.yaml` on a rebuilt cluster or the Deployment will stay broken.
14. **knowledge search can fail right after a rebuild even when Typesense is healthy** — if `system_knowledge` is missing you will see `404 {"message":"Collection not found"}`. The CLI now auto-heals this on first `joelclaw knowledge search` by recreating the collection and re-syncing ADRs + skills, but an explicit `joelclaw knowledge sync` is still the blunt proof command.
15. **PDS rebuilds are a two-step restore, not just a Helm install** — recreate `bluesky-pds-secrets`, reinstall the `bluesky-pds` Helm release, force the service `nodePort` back to `3000`, then recreate Joel's account if the PVC was wiped. The new account returns a fresh DID, so update the `pds_joel_did` secret afterward or host dual-write will keep authenticating against a dead repo.
16. **PDS session auth is handle-first in practice** — on the rebuilt PDS, `com.atproto.server.createSession` succeeded against `joel.pds.panda.tail7af24.ts.net` but rejected the raw DID. `packages/system-bus/src/lib/pds.ts` now resolves the handle from `pds_joel_did` via `describeRepo` before it asks for a session, which keeps the dual-write path aligned with reality.
17. **Typesense "Too many open files" masquerades as raft ERROR** — during large HNSW reindexes (e.g. `docs_chunks_v2` ~223k rows), Typesense exhausts its 1024 default FD limit and starts logging `Fail to open /proc/self/fd: Too many open files`. The pod stays `Running` but 503s everything, and the external symptom is identical to a raft leader-election failure. Fix: wrap the container command with `ulimit -n 1048576` before exec-ing `/opt/typesense-server`. Canonical form lives in `k8s/typesense.yaml` since 2026-04-19.
18. **Talos container memory cap is separate from the Colima VM size** — Docker can leave `joelclaw-controlplane-1` at a 4 GiB cap even when the VM has 24 GiB. Every k8s pod inside Talos shares that cap. Under Typesense `otel_events` / `docs_chunks_v2` load the Talos container can peg and make Typesense plus operator access look dead together. Live fix without restart: `ssh -F ~/.colima/_lima/colima/ssh.config lima-colima "sudo docker update --restart unless-stopped --memory=18g --memory-swap=18g joelclaw-controlplane-1"`. `infra/k8s-reboot-heal.sh` now reasserts this cap on each recovery tick.
19. **`joelclaw.com/api/docs/*` 502 can be a host-port exposure failure, not a docs-api pod failure** — the public web route proxies to `https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net/api/docs`, and Tailscale Funnel serves `/api/docs` by proxying Panda-local `localhost:3838`. If `kubectl get pod -n joelclaw -l app=docs-api` is healthy but `lsof -nP -iTCP:3838 -sTCP:LISTEN` is empty, Funnel returns bare 502s and Vercel propagates them. Fast proof: `curl -i https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net/api/docs/health` fails while `kubectl port-forward -n joelclaw svc/docs-api 3838:3838` makes it pass. Temporary repair: start that port-forward; durable repair is restoring the Colima/Lima host-published NodePort path for `3838`, not declaring the pod healthy and moving on.
20. **Root cause pattern for closed NodePorts after Colima churn** — if most host-published ports are closed and only manual `kubectl port-forward` listeners exist, inspect `~/.colima/_lima/_networks/user-v2/usernet.user-v2.stderr.log`. Lima 2.0.3 can panic in `pkg/networks/usernet/gvproxy.go` (`Failed to get FD via socketinvalid argument`, `index out of range`) and leave host publishing half-dead. The 2026-05-30 recovery also found the inverse failure with `portForwarder: grpc`: service ports stayed open while Colima SSH and the Docker socket died; switching live to `portForwarder: ssh` restored Docker briefly but cancelled service port forwarding. The current mitigation is Colima `portForwarder: grpc` plus direct operator ports (`6443` / `50000`), with Docker/SSH treated as a separate health gate rather than assumed healthy. After a Colima force-cycle, `joelclaw-controlplane-1` may remain `Exited (255)` unless its Docker restart policy is `unless-stopped`. Durable recovery sequence: clean stale usernet/SSH state, `colima stop --force && colima start`, `docker start joelclaw-controlplane-1`, `docker update --restart unless-stopped --memory=18g --memory-swap=18g joelclaw-controlplane-1`, `ssh lima-colima "sudo modprobe br_netfilter"`, then restart flannel if pods fail with missing `/run/flannel/subnet.env`. Verify `localhost:3838`, `8108`, `8288`, `9070`, `9627`, `6443`, and `50000` are real Docker/Lima listeners, not ad hoc `kubectl port-forward` stand-ins.
