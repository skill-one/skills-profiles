# Loop Nanny

Monitor, triage, and clean up after agent loops. The agent-loop skill starts loops. This skill keeps them healthy.

## Monitor a Running Loop

```bash
joelclaw loop status <LOOP_ID>
```

`joelclaw` is the primary CLI.

Poll every 2–3 minutes. A story typically takes 3–8 minutes (test-write → implement → review → judge). If a story shows no progress for 10+ minutes, something is stuck.

### Reading Status Output

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `✅ PASS` | Story completed | None |
| `⏭ SKIP` | Exhausted retries | Check if code landed anyway (common — see Skip Triage) |
| `▶ STORY.DISPATCHED` | Implementor running | Wait |
| `▶ TESTS.WRITTEN` | Reviewer running | Wait |
| `▶ CHECKS.COMPLETED` | Judge evaluating | Wait |
| `▶ STORY.RETRIED` | Failed, retrying | Check attempt output for patterns |
| `▶ RETRO.COMPLETED` | Loop finishing (merge-back) | Wait for merge, then verify |
| `⏳ pending` | Not yet started | Normal — queued |

## Skip Triage

A skipped story is unresolved until source and behavioral evidence establish what landed. Inspect the actual failure; do not assume the generated test is wrong.

### Check if skipped work actually landed

```bash
# 1. Read the attempt output
cat /tmp/agent-loop/<LOOP_ID>/<STORY_ID>-<ATTEMPT>.out | tail -40

# 2. Check if the files exist on main after merge
ls <project>/path/to/expected/file

# 3. Check git log for the story's commits
cd <project> && git log --oneline --grep="<STORY_ID>" -5
```

### Common skip causes

| Pattern | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| "Already exists" | Story duplicates work from prior story | Write more atomic stories; planner didn't know current state |
| Test assertion failure | Inspect the test and production behavior; a real regression may be the cause | Acceptance criteria should test behavior, not implementation |
| TypeScript compile error | Story depends on types from a skipped story | Order stories so type-providing stories run first |
| Timeout | Implementor took too long | Smaller story scope |

## Post-Loop Cleanup

After merge-back completes (status shows `RETRO.COMPLETED` then resolves):

### 1. Verify merge landed

```bash
cd <project> && git log --oneline -5
# Should show: "Merge branch 'agent-loop/<LOOP_ID>'"
```

### 2. Run affected and repository-required checks

```bash
# Use the target project's configured test command and preserve its exit status.
```

### 3. Inspect failing acceptance tests

Read each failing test and its production behavior. Agent authorship does not make coverage disposable. If a valid test exposes a production regression, repair production code. Repair the test only when its expectations are wrong. Remove an exact obsolete test only after inspecting it and establishing that removal is within the task's scope. Never delete a test family to make a suite pass.

### 4. TypeScript check

```bash
cd <project> && bunx tsc --noEmit
```

### 5. Restart worker deployment (if loop touched Inngest functions)

```bash
kubectl -n joelclaw rollout restart deployment/system-bus-worker
kubectl -n joelclaw rollout status deployment/system-bus-worker --timeout=180s
joelclaw refresh
joelclaw status
```

### 6. Commit cleanup

```bash
cd <project> && git add -- <task-owned-paths> && git commit -m "chore: post-loop cleanup for <LOOP_ID>

Record actual cleanup and validation results"
```

## When to Intervene

### Don't intervene — let the loop work
- Story on first attempt (even if slow)
- Story retrying with feedback (judge gave actionable feedback)
- Story just skipped but later stories are still pending

### Intervene — something is broken
- **Same error on retry**: Check attempt output. If retry 2 has identical error to retry 1, the feedback loop isn't helping — cancel and fix the root cause.
- **Merge conflict during complete**: `joelclaw logs errors` will show merge abort. Manually resolve: `cd <project> && git merge --abort` then merge the branch by hand.
- **Worker crashed**: `joelclaw status` shows worker down. Restart deployment: `kubectl -n joelclaw rollout restart deployment/system-bus-worker`
- **All stories skipping**: The PRD likely has a bad assumption. Cancel, review prd.json, re-fire.
- **Loop stuck (no progress for 15min)**: Check `joelclaw runs --count 5` — if the latest run is COMPLETED but no new run dispatched, there's a state bug. Cancel and re-fire from the stuck story.

### Cancel a stuck loop

```bash
joelclaw loop cancel <LOOP_ID>

# Clean up worktree manually (cancel doesn't auto-merge)
cd <project>
# Inspect the cancelled worktree and unmerged commits first.
# Preserve unharvested changes. Remove only an owned, harvested worktree
# with git worktree remove; retain branches containing unmerged work.
```

## Reading Attempt Output

Each story attempt writes to `/tmp/agent-loop/<LOOP_ID>/<STORY_ID>-<ATTEMPT>.out`. These contain the implementor/reviewer's full output (diffs, reasoning, test results).

```bash
# Quick scan — last 40 lines usually has the verdict
tail -40 /tmp/agent-loop/<LOOP_ID>/<STORY_ID>-<ATTEMPT>.out

# Check all attempts for a story
ls /tmp/agent-loop/<LOOP_ID>/<STORY_ID>-*.out

# Grep for errors across all attempts
grep -i "error\|fail\|reject" /tmp/agent-loop/<LOOP_ID>/*.out
```

## Monitoring Checklist

Use this sequence when babysitting a loop:

```
1. joelclaw loop status <LOOP_ID>          — where are we?
2. (if story running) wait 3 min, re-check
3. (if story skipped) check attempt output — did the work land anyway?
4. (if loop completed) verify merge and affected behavior; repair valid tests; restart only when the requested repair requires it
5. (if stuck) joelclaw runs --count 5 + joelclaw logs errors — diagnose
```

## Improve joelclaw While You Nanny

The nanny is the primary consumer of `joelclaw` output. When you hit a gap — missing info, unclear output, an extra step you had to do manually — **fix joelclaw right then**. The joelclaw source lives at `~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/`.

### What to improve

- **Missing data in output**: `joelclaw loop status` doesn't show story descriptions? Add them.
- **Manual steps that should be commands**: Had to `kubectl logs` directly? Add it to `joelclaw logs`.
- **Bad next_actions**: The suggested next commands don't match what you actually needed? Fix the HATEOAS.
- **Error without fix**: Got an error with no `fix` field? Add one via `respondError()`.
- **New command needed**: Found yourself running raw curl/GraphQL? Wrap it in a joelclaw command.

### How to improve

```bash
# Commands are in packages/cli/src/commands/ — one file per command
# Response helpers in packages/cli/src/response.ts
# Inngest client methods in packages/cli/src/inngest.ts

# Test your change
joelclaw <command> 2>&1 | python3 -m json.tool

# Commit
git add -- <task-owned-paths> && git commit -m "feat: joelclaw <command> — <what you added>"
```

Follow the [cli-design skill](../cli-design/SKILL.md): JSON always, HATEOAS next_actions, context-safe output, errors with fixes. After improving joelclaw, update this skill doc if the monitoring workflow changed.

## Diagnosing Stalled Loops

When a loop stops progressing, use the diagnostic command FIRST:

```bash
# Quick diagnosis of all loops
joelclaw loop diagnose all -c

# Diagnose + auto-fix (clears claims, re-fires plan events)
joelclaw loop diagnose all -c --fix

# Verify fix worked (~30s later)
joelclaw loop status <loop-id> -c
```

Common diagnoses:
- **CHAIN_BROKEN** — judge→plan event was lost. `--fix` re-fires the plan event.
- **ORPHANED_CLAIM** — agent died but claim remains. `--fix` clears claim + re-fires.
- **STUCK_RUN** — Inngest run active but agent dead. `--fix` clears + re-fires.
- **WORKER_UNHEALTHY** — fewer functions than expected. `--fix` restarts worker.

See [loop-diagnosis skill](../loop-diagnosis/SKILL.md) for full reference.

## Gotchas

- **Shared loops:** Use an isolated worktree or non-overlapping owned paths. Stage exact task changes; another loop does not block unrelated work.
- **CLI-focused edits are safest during active loops** — avoid changing `packages/system-bus` mid-run unless you're intentionally redeploying the worker
- **prd.json and progress.txt get dirty** — this is normal; complete.ts stashes before merge
- **Worktree branch not auto-deleted on cancel** — clean manually (see Cancel section)
- **Cross-file test pollution** — investigate test isolation failures; preserve valid coverage and fix the shared-state defect
