# Sync System Bus Worker

Deploy `system-bus-worker` to the local joelclaw k8s cluster (Talos v1.12.4 / k8s v1.35.0).

**Important:** `.github/workflows/system-bus-worker-deploy.yml` has a deploy job on `self-hosted`. That runner does not exist, so deploys must be completed locally.

## Quick Deploy

The publish script handles everything — build, auth, push, k8s apply, rollout, verification:

```bash
cd ~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw
k8s/publish-system-bus-worker.sh
```

Optional: pass a tag (defaults to timestamp):
```bash
k8s/publish-system-bus-worker.sh a6de1e0
```

### GHCR Auth Order

`publish-system-bus-worker.sh` now authenticates in this order:
1. `GHCR_TOKEN` env var (if provided)
2. `secrets lease ghcr_pat` (agent-secrets)
3. `gh auth token` fallback

If your `gh auth token` lacks `read:packages/write:packages`, push will 403. Use `ghcr_pat`.

## What the Script Does

1. Builds ARM64 Docker image (required — Talos/Colima node is aarch64)
2. Authenticates to GHCR (prefers `agent-secrets` lease `ghcr_pat`; falls back to `gh auth token`) with temp Docker config
3. Pushes `ghcr.io/joelhooks/system-bus-worker:${TAG}` and `:latest`
4. Updates the image ref in `k8s/system-bus-worker.yaml`
5. `kubectl apply` the manifest
6. Waits for rollout (`--timeout=180s`)
7. Probes the new pod's health endpoint

## Post-Deploy Verification

```bash
joelclaw refresh                           # Re-register functions with Inngest
joelclaw functions | grep "<new-function>" # Verify new function appears
joelclaw status                            # Full health check
joelclaw runs --count 3                    # Confirm runs are flowing
```

## Restart Safety (ADR-0156)

The worker is stateless between Inngest steps. Each step is a separate HTTP call; Inngest stores step output server-side. This means k8s rolling restarts are safe — Inngest retries the in-flight step against the new pod.

**Critical rule: NEVER set `retries: 0` on Inngest functions.** With retries: 0, a worker restart during step execution kills the run permanently. With retries ≥ 1, Inngest retries and hits the new pod.

Current story-pipeline has `retries: 2` specifically to survive the ~1s restart window during deploys.

### What happens during deploy

```
Step executing on old pod → old pod terminates → step fails (SDK unreachable)
→ Inngest retries after backoff → new pod handles retry → step completes
```

All previously completed steps are memoized. Only the in-flight step reruns.

### Long-running steps (codex implement: 5-10 min)

If a deploy kills a codex step mid-execution, the step reruns from scratch on the new pod (5-10 min wasted but not fatal). For time-critical deploys during active loops, check `joelclaw loop status` first and deploy between stories.

## Manual Steps (if script fails)

### Build

```bash
cd ~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw
TAG=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
IMAGE="ghcr.io/joelhooks/system-bus-worker:${TAG}"
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t "$IMAGE" -t ghcr.io/joelhooks/system-bus-worker:latest -f packages/system-bus/Dockerfile .
```

### Push

```bash
gh auth token | docker login ghcr.io -u $(gh api user -q .login) --password-stdin
docker push "$IMAGE"
docker push ghcr.io/joelhooks/system-bus-worker:latest
```

### Deploy

```bash
kubectl -n joelclaw set image deployment/system-bus-worker system-bus-worker="$IMAGE"
kubectl -n joelclaw rollout status deployment/system-bus-worker --timeout=180s
```

### Verify

```bash
joelclaw refresh
joelclaw status
```

### Receipt

Verify the rollout and keep the image/digest plus command output as the deploy receipt. Runtime deploy telemetry belongs in canonical OTel; durable behavior/config changes belong in the relevant Brain `.svx`. The former `slog` journal is retired.

## Talon Rebuild (Adding Secrets / Changing Worker Supervision)

Talon is a Rust binary that supervises the worker process. It leases secrets from `agent-secrets` and injects them as env vars. When adding new webhook secrets or changing supervision behavior:

```bash
# 1. Add secret to agent-secrets
secrets add my_new_secret --value "the-secret-value"

# 2. Update Talon source — add mapping to SECRET_MAPPINGS array
#    File: ~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/infra/talon/src/worker.rs
#    ("my_new_secret", "MY_NEW_SECRET_ENV_VAR"),

# 3. Recompile (fast — ~3s incremental)
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
cd ~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/infra/talon
cargo build --release

# 4. Install + re-sign (macOS kills unsigned binaries)
cp target/release/talon ~/.local/bin/talon
codesign -fs - ~/.local/bin/talon

# 5. Restart via launchd
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.joel.talon
sleep 1
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.joel.talon.plist
sleep 12

# 6. Verify
curl -s http://localhost:3111/ | jq '.status'
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3111/api/inngest  # Force function sync
```

### Current SECRET_MAPPINGS (worker.rs)

| Secret Name | Env Var |

| `claude_oauth_token` | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` |
| `todoist_client_secret` | `TODOIST_CLIENT_SECRET` |
| `todoist_api_token` | `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` |
| `front_rules_webhook_secret` | `FRONT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| `front_api_token` | `FRONT_API_TOKEN` |
| `vercel_webhook_secret` | `VERCEL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| `joelclaw_webhook_secret` | `JOELCLAW_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| `revalidation_secret` | `REVALIDATION_SECRET` |

### Gotcha: `codesign -fs -` is required

After `cargo build`, the binary has adhoc linker-signed signature. macOS launchd may SIGKILL:9 it. Re-signing with `codesign -fs -` fixes this.

## Common Gotchas

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `exec format error` in pod | Built for amd64, not arm64 | Rebuild with `--platform linux/arm64` |
| GHCR push fails with `403 Forbidden` on blob HEAD | `gh auth token` missing package scopes | Use `ghcr_pat` via `agent-secrets` or export `GHCR_TOKEN` with package scope |
| `docker-credential-desktop` error | Docker config has credsStore | Script uses temp config dir — if manual, remove `"credsStore": "desktop"` |
| Function missing after deploy | Not in the index for the worker that should own it | Add it to `index.cluster.ts` for cluster-owned callbacks or `index.host.ts` for host-only work; do **not** blindly add to both or Inngest will create duplicate runs |
| Function still missing | Stale Inngest registration | `joelclaw refresh` then check again |
| "Unable to reach SDK URL" | Worker pod not ready | Wait for rollout, then `joelclaw refresh` |
| Runs stuck after deploy | `retries: 0` on the function | Set `retries: 2` minimum (ADR-0156) |
| Stale app registrations | Multiple apps registered | Delete old registrations in Inngest dashboard (`:8289`) |
