# Signal Friction Scan

Use this to turn recent session history into a grounded shortlist of improvements: skill patches, new skills, docs, runbooks, commands, monitors, automations, or deliberate skips.

This is a **scan and synthesis skill**, not a license to mutate the system immediately. Default to Pass 1: investigate, produce a shortlist, and stop unless Joel explicitly asks to create or patch assets.

## When to Use

Trigger on requests like:

- "scan friction"
- "find repeated workflows"
- "what should we package?"
- "look at recent sessions"
- "find missing skills"
- "turn recent work into skills"
- "what keeps pissing me off?"
- "capture the signal/friction scan process"
- "find prompt/system skill improvements from recent work"

Also use it when a task asks for repeated patterns across recent Codex/Pi work, especially if the output should become durable process.

## Evidence Order

Use available evidence in this order:

1. Local session signals and friction scans.
2. Targeted session searches and bounded extracts for high-signal hits.
3. Existing skills and docs, to avoid duplicates.
4. `.brain/`, vault, ADRs, project docs, and swarm memory when relevant.
5. Source repos, logs, issue trackers, Slack/email/task systems only when needed to verify a candidate.

Chronicle or GUI history is discovery-only. Confirm important details in source systems before recommending mutations.

## Core Commands

Start with local machine facts:

```bash
hostname
pwd
```

Run the broad signal scan:

```bash
joelclaw sessions signals \
  --kind any \
  --source local \
  --machine "$(hostname -s)" \
  --since 30d \
  --limit 40 \
  --evaluate
```

Run a focused friction scan:

```bash
joelclaw sessions friction \
  --source local \
  --machine "$(hostname -s)" \
  --since 30d \
  --limit 30
```

If `hostname -s` does not match the machine id used by session capture, rerun with the observed machine id from recent session paths or known context, for example:

```bash
joelclaw sessions signals --kind any --source local --machine blaine-the-mono --since 30d --limit 40 --evaluate
```

Use targeted searches to triangulate themes:

Use `recall` and the current `session-search` contract. Keep private queries in structured MCP arguments. Raw evidence requires a scope-bound `evidenceDrilldownReceipt`; missing projections do not grant raw access.

Inspect existing skill coverage:

```bash
find ~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/skills -maxdepth 2 -name SKILL.md -print
find ~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/skills -maxdepth 2 -name SKILL.md -print \
  | xargs rg -n "friction|signals|workflow-pattern|mode-mismatch|<candidate-term>"
```

Use bounded extracts only for candidates that may become concrete work:

Use `recall` and the current `session-search` contract. Keep private queries in structured MCP arguments. Raw evidence requires a scope-bound `evidenceDrilldownReceipt`; missing projections do not grant raw access.

## How to Read Signals

Treat `sessions signals` as radar, not truth.

Look at:

- `evaluation.bySurface`: where improvements are likely to land.
- `evaluation.byKind`: decision, friction, workflow-pattern, praise, correction, preference.
- `evaluation.byReviewPriority`: high-priority candidates first.
- `clusters`: repeated problem classes.
- `hits[].improvement`: proposed surface, target, confidence, and reason.
- transcript paths, line numbers, dates, and exact user turns.

Do not overfit on single words. Joel's `fuck`, `fucking`, and `fuckin` are emphasis, not automatically anger. Classify by nearby critique, correction, approval, or preference.

Common high-value surfaces:

- `skill`: repeated procedural failure or missing operating method.
- `system-prompt`: cross-cutting response shape, action bias, voice, or boundary issue.
- `docs`: project-local instructions, runbooks, or source summaries.
- `memory`: durable decision or reusable preference.
- `adr`: architecture/process decision that should be ratified.
- `harness`: tool availability, permissions, or runtime mismatch.

## Candidate Criteria

Only recommend packaging when most of these are true:

- repeated at least twice, or clearly likely to recur and costly to repeat
- stable inputs
- repeatable procedure
- clear output or stopping condition
- material improvement to speed, quality, consistency, reliability, or discoverability
- not already adequately covered
- validation is possible
- scope can stay narrow

Skip candidates that are one-off, speculative, too broad, mostly taste, private-sensitive, poorly evidenced, or already covered well enough.

## Existing Asset Check

Before proposing a new skill, inspect for existing coverage:

- canonical skills in `~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/skills`
- project-local `.pi/skills`, `.agents/skills`, and `.brain`
- scripts, CLIs, Inngest functions, monitors, GitHub Actions
- ADRs, runbooks, and project docs

Prefer **extend existing** over creating a duplicate. New skills are for missing reusable workflows, not every interesting pattern.

## Output Shape

For Pass 1, return only a shortlist and recommendations. Do not edit files.

Use this shape:

```markdown
**Evidence Inspected**

- Commands run and notable counts.
- Existing assets checked.
- Sources unavailable or failed.

**Shortlist**

| Candidate | Evidence | Frequency / Confidence | Pain | Recommended Form | Existing Assets | Recommendation |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|

**Highest-Confidence Recommendations**

1. <candidate>
   Why:
   Scope:
   Validation:

**Deliberately Skipped**

- <candidate and reason>

**Needs More Evidence**

- <candidate and exact missing evidence>

**Validation Performed**

- No files modified, unless explicitly requested.
- Commands run and their results.
```

Keep the report compact. Lead with the useful answer, then receipts.

## Pass 2 Creation Rules

Only create or patch assets when Joel explicitly asks for Pass 2 or asks to capture a specific candidate.

When creating:

- Use the smallest form: patch existing skill/doc before creating new.
- Keep the artifact narrow, source-aware, and easy to validate.
- Do not include raw transcript dumps.
- Do not capture secrets, private overlays, paid corpus text, or irrelevant machine config.
- Include exact commands and fallback behavior where possible.
- Run validation commands or explain why no validation exists.
- Inspect `git status --short` first and preserve unrelated user work.

For a new joelclaw skill, follow `add-skill`: create under `~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/skills/<name>`, keep frontmatter `name` matching the directory, symlink only where needed, record durable workflow decisions in Brain `.svx`, and commit only if Joel asks or the current workflow requires it.

## Failure Handling

- If `joelclaw sessions signals` emits huge output or times out after useful JSON, use the emitted counts/clusters and say it timed out.
- Do not depend on the retired `slog` journal. Use OTel for runtime evidence and Brain `.svx` for durable receipts.
- If local machine session capture is thin, search Typesense or the relevant remote machine via `session-search`.
- If evidence is thin, say the evidence is thin. Do not fabricate patterns.
