# System Architecture (Canonical Topology)

This skill is the **single source of truth** for joelclaw system wiring.

Freshness notes:

- **2026-08-23 recall cutover:** `memory_observations` and the system-log JSONL/`slog` path are retired. Production `joelclaw recall` composes lane-separated flowing reflections, flowing observations, and curated Brain pages. Every request has explicit scope and access. Chorus/Rhizomatic is parked with no briefing injection or live claims; service stop still needs steering sudo. Claude auto-memory is a pointer index, not a content store.
- **2026-07-10 topology:** the old Panda-centric mental model is migration debt. Current responsibility lanes:

- **Central**: Flagg/Mac Studio. It is authoritative for agent-mail and Run capture ingress; verify each remaining service family during migration.
- **Relay**: Panda account-bound leftovers and explicit decommission blockers.
- **Satellite**: Blaine/other capture clients, connectors, outboxes, and transcript backup freshness.

Treat older “Panda is the whole system” wording as stale unless re-verified against live receipts.

Use it for:

- "why did this run / not run"
- "which worker handles this function"
- "what is listening on port X"
- "how does event Y flow"
- "where does this Run/capture/memory record go"
- "is this Central, Relay, satellite, or shadow runtime work"
- full-stack routing/debug across CLI → Inngest → workers → gateway → telemetry

The old mental model was "Panda is joelclaw." That is no longer precise enough.

Current authority split (verified 2026-07-10):

- **Flagg is authoritative for agent-mail and Run capture ingress.** The agent-mail daemon binds Flagg loopback; Blaine and Panda use SSH connector LaunchAgents so every `joelclaw mail` client reaches the same mailbox without exposing the service on the tailnet.
- **Panda is migration debt plus Relay responsibilities.** Its independent agent-mail daemon and Talon are removed. A reboot-survivable SSH connector now binds Panda IPv4 loopback `127.0.0.1:3111` and forwards legacy `/api/runs` and `/webhooks` ingress to Flagg. The legacy system worker still owns the IPv6 listener until its system LaunchDaemon is booted out with sudo.
- **Satellites stay thin**. They run Pi/Codex/Claude, local capture hooks, and connectors to Central. Do not install independent stateful Central services on a satellite without a specific reason.
- **SQLite indexes Runs**. NAS/local Run blobs are the source of truth; `sessions.db` is the compact live FTS index. The retired Typesense `runs_dev` and `run_chunks_dev` collections must not be recreated.
- **Flagg splits book search from the operational Typesense node.** The system LaunchDaemon on `127.0.0.1:8108` holds operational projections. The user LaunchAgent `com.joelclaw.typesense-books` on `127.0.0.1:8110` holds `docs` and `docs_chunks_v2`. `DOCS_TYPESENSE_URL` routes book readers and writers. A tailnet-only TCP forward exposes `8110` to Blaine.
- **The book node is not a replica.** A Typesense replica would copy every collection and repeat the same memory and startup cost. The separate process gives book indexing its own failure and restart boundary.

Cutover rule: avoid split-brain. Panda and Flagg must not both accept authoritative writes for the same Central service family. Gate 5 permits shadow smoke tests and migration rehearsal, but authority flips only inside an approved freeze/cutover window.

Flagg Gate 4 is complete: shadow Central recovered after hard reboot with no GUI login. Gate 5 is not complete until Flagg owns Central state, workers, endpoints, and verification while Panda is frozen as rollback-only.

### Known runtime endpoints

- Colima VM IP: `192.168.64.2` (`colima status --json`)
- Kubernetes API (stable operator tunnel): `https://127.0.0.1:16443`
- Talos API (stable operator tunnel): `127.0.0.1:15000`
- Tailnet hostnames seen in config:
  - `panda.tail7af24.ts.net` (Caddy routes)
  - `pds.panda.tail7af24.ts.net` (PDS values)
  - `flagg.tail7af24.ts.net` (Mac Studio shadow / target Central host)
  - `blaine.tail7af24.ts.net` (satellite)
- Current live Run capture URL for satellites:
  - `https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net/api/runs`
  - served by Panda host system-bus worker on `localhost:3111`
  - do **not** use `http://panda:3000` or `http://panda.tail7af24.ts.net:3000`; Panda has no durable Central web listener there.

### Tailscale mesh state

- `tailscale status --json` failed in this environment: **UNKNOWN — needs manual verification**

## 2) Process Inventory (Long-Running)

### Herdr launch-domain split

- `com.joelclaw.herdr-server` is the default interactive server. It runs as a per-user LaunchAgent in `gui/<uid>` so pane descendants inherit the Aqua bootstrap namespace and can reach user Keychain services.
- `com.joelclaw.herdr-system-server` is the boot-safe automation server. It remains a system LaunchDaemon and owns only the named `system` Herdr session.
- Never install the default server as a system LaunchDaemon. A `UserName` on a LaunchDaemon changes the Unix identity, not the launchd bootstrap namespace. Native macOS clients in those panes cannot resolve the user's `com.apple.securityd.xpc` service.
- The installer and cutover contract lives in `infra/install-herdr-default-launchagent.sh`. The durable rationale is `.brain/resources/herdr-launch-domain-contract.svx`.

### Process supervision behavior: `worker-supervisor`

Source: `infra/worker-supervisor/src/main.rs`

- Default config:
  - worker dir: `~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw/packages/system-bus`
  - command: `bun run src/serve.ts`
  - port: `3111`
  - health endpoint: `/api/inngest`
  - sync endpoint: `/api/inngest` (PUT)
  - health interval: 30s
  - restart after 3 consecutive health failures
  - restart backoff: 1s → 30s max
- Pre-start kills stale process on port 3111.
- Runs host import preflight before spawn:
  - `bun --eval "await import('./src/inngest/functions/index.host.ts');"`
  - on failure, skips spawn and retries with exponential backoff
- Loads env from `~/.config/system-bus.env` plus leased secrets.
- Forces `WORKER_ROLE=host` for the supervised host worker.
- Emits OTEL events via CLI on supervisor failures/restarts:
  - `worker.supervisor.preflight.failed`
  - `worker.supervisor.worker_exit`
  - `worker.supervisor.health_check.restart`

### Worker supervision split note

- Talon is running (`com.joel.talon`), but host worker is still launched via `com.joel.system-bus-worker` -> `worker-supervisor`.
- ADR + system-log indicate Talon can defer worker supervision during coexistence.

### Restate / Firecracker runtime note

- `deployment/restate-worker` is the current durable execution worker. The image bundles Bun + Node + `pi` + `codex`, the full repo checkout, and 76 symlinked skills.
- Runtime auth/identity come from `secret/pi-auth` and `configmap/agent-identity`, which recreate `/root/.pi/agent/auth.json` plus the joelclaw identity chain inside the pod.
- Firecracker is enabled in-pod via privileged access to `/dev/kvm` on Colima VZ. The `/dev/kvm` hostPath mount uses type `""` (optional) so the pod starts without it when nestedVirtualization is off.
- Persistent microVM assets live on PVC `firecracker-images`, mounted at `/tmp/firecracker-test` for kernel, rootfs, and snapshot files.
- **Retry caps (2026-03-17)**: dagWorker maxAttempts=5, dagOrchestrator maxAttempts=3. Prevents Restate journal poisoning from infinite retries after code changes or infrastructure failures.
- **Colima stability**: nestedVirtualization is OFF by default (crashes VM under Docker build load). Toggle ON only for Firecracker testing sessions, then toggle OFF. See k8s skill for recovery procedures.

### Control-plane access

- kube API exposed locally at `127.0.0.1:16443` via `com.joel.kube-operator-access` (`ssh -S none -o ControlPath=none -L 16443:10.5.0.2:6443`)
- Talos API exposed locally at `127.0.0.1:15000` via the same daemon (`ssh -S none -o ControlPath=none -L 15000:10.5.0.2:50000`)
- NodePort/runtime app ports still come from Colima/Lima forwarding; the operator daemon exists specifically because the direct host-published 6443 path was not boring after the rebuild

## 3) Worker Architecture (Role Split + Registration)

Source files:

- `packages/system-bus/src/serve.ts`
- `packages/system-bus/src/inngest/functions/index.host.ts`
- `packages/system-bus/src/inngest/functions/index.cluster.ts`
- `packages/system-bus/src/inngest/client.ts`

## Role model

- `WORKER_ROLE` parsed as `host` (default) or `cluster`.
- Registered function set is role-dependent:
  - host uses `hostFunctionDefinitions`
  - cluster uses `clusterFunctionDefinitions`

## Ground-truth counts

- Measured from the imported definition arrays on 2026-07-29:
  - Host function set: **163**
  - Cluster function set: **14**
- `gateway/external-delivery-canary` is host-only. It appends synthetic
  `message.requested` events and watches the canonical event log. It does not run
  in the gateway driver, transport daemon, or gateway session.
- Cluster subset functions:
  - `agent/approval-request`, `agent/approval-resolve`
  - `todoist-comment-notify`, `todoist-task-completed-notify`, `todoist-task-created-notify`
  - `github-workflow-run-completed-notify`, `github-package-published-notify`
  - `webhook-subscription-dispatch-generic`
  - `webhook-subscription-dispatch-github-workflow-run-completed`
  - `memory/observe-session`
  - `queue/observer`, `queue/observer-requested`
  - `swarm-orchestrator`, `swarm-agent-exec`

## App registration isolation

From `inngest/client.ts`:

- app id resolves to:
  - `system-bus-host` when role is host
  - `system-bus-cluster` when role is cluster
- explicit `INNGEST_APP_ID` overrides role-derived id.

This prevents host and cluster workers from overwriting each other’s function graphs.

## serveHost behavior

From `serve.ts`:

- host role default `serveHost`: `http://host.docker.internal:3111`
- cluster role default `serveHost`: unset (connect-mode default)
- `INNGEST_SERVE_HOST` overrides either role.
- `INNGEST_CONNECT_MODE=1|true|yes` starts `inngest/connect` with `instanceId=system-bus-<role>-<hostname>` and `maxWorkerConcurrency=8`.
- `/api/inngest` now explicitly allows only `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT`; `PATCH`, `OPTIONS`, and `DELETE` return `405` with `Allow: GET, POST, PUT`.
- `/api/inngest` logs bounded request summaries for failed or ambiguous POST/PUT callbacks, including safe query/debug keys and body shape, not raw huge payloads.
- Bun server `idleTimeout=255` because registration PUTs can exceed the default 10s while the self-hosted runtime is under cron/backlog pressure.

Kubernetes cluster worker manifest sets:

- `INNGEST_BASE_URL=http://inngest-svc:8288`
- `INNGEST_SERVE_HOST=http://system-bus-worker:3111`
- `TYPESENSE_URL=http://typesense:8108`
- image: `ghcr.io/joelhooks/system-bus-worker:d7dd7788` (recorded after Inngest SDK advisory hardening)

Panda host worker config should advertise an SDK callback URL the Inngest pod can actually reach. Current docs call out `INNGEST_SERVE_HOST=http://100.93.201.72:3111` on Panda. Do not assume `host.lima.internal` or `host.docker.internal` works from inside Talos unless a live pod-to-host probe proves it.

## Registration mechanics

- Worker exposes `GET|POST|PUT /api/inngest`.
- Worker sends a delayed self-sync `PUT /api/inngest` ~5s after startup.
- `worker-supervisor` also performs startup PUT sync.

## Host is primary today

From index comments + function lists:

- ADR-0089 transition: host remains authoritative for broad function ownership.
- Cluster is intentionally limited to cluster-safe subset (12 functions).

---

## 4) Event Flow (CLI → Inngest → Worker → Completion)

## Canonical flow: `joelclaw send`

1. CLI `joelclaw send <event>` calls `Inngest.send()`.
2. `Inngest.send()` POSTs event JSON to:
   - `${INNGEST_URL}/e/${INNGEST_EVENT_KEY}`
   - default: `http://localhost:8288/e/<key>`
   - 2026-06-18: Pi `memory-enforcer` observe events must follow this keyed Event API shape too; never POST to bare `/e/`. The extension resolves `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` from env/local env files and skips observe emission when no key is available.
3. Inngest server persists the event and resolves matching function triggers.
4. Inngest dispatches function steps to the worker app graph that owns that function ID:
   - host app (`system-bus-host`) for 101-host set
   - cluster app (`system-bus-cluster`) for 12-cluster subset
5. Worker handles callbacks via `/api/inngest` (Hono + `inngest/hono` handler).
6. Each `step.run` result is memoized by Inngest; next step executes when prior completes.
7. Completion/failure is queryable via GraphQL (`/v0/gql`) and CLI commands (`runs`, `run`, `event`, `events`).

## Run capture flow: Machine hook → Central `/api/runs` → `memory/run.captured`

1. Runtime-native hook captures only the new Run slice:
   - Pi extension for Pi
   - Claude Code Stop hook via `scripts/joelclaw-capture-session.ts`
   - Codex hook/helper via `scripts/joelclaw-capture-codex-session.js`
   - server-side runtimes can call capture inline instead of shelling through a hook.
2. The hook posts JSON to Central:
   - current live URL for satellites: `POST https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net/api/runs`
   - Panda serves this through the host system-bus worker on `localhost:3111`
   - auth: `Authorization: Bearer <~/.joelclaw/auth.json token>`
3. `packages/system-bus/src/serve.ts` validates the bearer token against the persistent local SQLite registry `~/.joelclaw/capture-auth.db`. The worker refreshes this four-row registry from Typesense `machines_dev` in the background every five minutes. Known-token requests never wait for Typesense; an unknown token gets one bounded migration lookup.
4. Worker writes the raw source of truth through `@joelclaw/memory#writeRunBlob`:
   - default dev store: `~/.joelclaw/runs-dev/<user>/<yyyy-mm>/<run-id>.jsonl`
   - companion metadata includes `user_id`, `machine_id`, `agent_runtime`, parent/conversation IDs, tags, byte count, and SHA-256.
5. Worker emits `memory/run.captured` to Inngest.
6. `packages/system-bus/src/inngest/functions/memory/run-captured.ts` appends Run metadata, chunks, and FTS rows to SQLite `sessions.db` in one transaction.
7. If POST fails from a Machine, the hook writes the POST body into `~/.joelclaw/outbox/`; the Machine does not become Central just because capture is temporarily offline.
8. If raw blobs exist but SQLite is stale, recover Inngest/worker registration first, then backfill with `scripts/backfill-session-index.ts`. Do not replay thousands of `memory/run.captured` events casually.
9. The public Vercel app is not a Run ingress or search surface. Its `POST /api/runs` and `POST /api/runs/search` routes return `410`. Machine hooks must use the Central system-bus endpoint, and operators must use `joelclaw sessions search`.

## Recall flow: scoped request → CLI composition root → lane-preserving result

1. Interactive callers run in a trusted GitHub checkout or pass both `--project`
   and `--workstream`. Automatic callers send one exact
   `ComposedRecallRequestV1` through `joelclaw recall --request-file -` on
   private stdin.
2. Every request names principal, purpose, allowed privacy tiers, supersession
   policy, and independent limits for reflections, observations, and curated
   pages. The deprecated `--limit` flag is ignored.
3. The CLI reads the pinned flowing-memory artifact and curated `critical.db`
   projection, then returns three separate lanes: `flowing-reflections`,
   `flowing-observations`, and `curated-pages`. Never merge their scores.
4. Unavailable lanes return typed envelopes and exit 3. The gateway shows a
   generic unavailable marker. Optional Inngest enrichment records redacted
   telemetry and returns no context. Restate returns a generic degraded marker.
5. Use `joelclaw sessions search "<query>" --source both --extract` for exact
   Run/session wording, commands, and transcript evidence. Composed recall is a
   broad memory surface, not raw transcript search.
6. `typesense-recall` is config-selected rollback only. Status reports it as a
   visible degraded warning without turning global health red.

**Accepted cluster decision (2026-08-23):** automatic recall inside the
system-bus and Restate cluster images is intentionally disabled/degraded after
retiring old observation recall. `packages/recall` is present for module
resolution, but the images do not receive a local semantic store or compiled
`joelclaw` recall binary. Callers must take their explicit optional-enrichment
degrade path. This is not a hidden deployment dependency. Re-enable cluster
recall only after a separately reviewed secure remote flowing-read substrate
exists.

## Queue flow: `joelclaw queue emit` → Restate drainer → durable dispatch

1. CLI `joelclaw queue emit <event>` persists a `QueueEventEnvelope` into Redis stream `joelclaw:queue:events` and indexes it in sorted set `joelclaw:queue:priority`.
2. The `restate-worker` k8s deployment (`packages/restate/src/index.ts`) starts a deterministic queue drainer beside the channel callback listener.
3. On startup, the drainer claims pending + never-delivered entries via `@joelclaw/queue#getUnacked()`, reindexes replayable entries, and emits OTEL replay evidence.
4. Each drain tick selects the next priority candidate from the sorted set, resolves its static registry target from `packages/queue/src/registry.ts`, and POSTs a one-node DAG request to Restate `/dagOrchestrator/{workflowId}/run/send`.
5. When backlog remains and a dispatch slot frees, the drainer self-pulses immediately instead of waiting for the next `QUEUE_DRAIN_INTERVAL_MS` heartbeat. That interval is now the idle poll / retry cadence, not a mandatory 2-second tax between successful sends.
6. The current Story-3 bridge re-emits the queue item to its registered Inngest event target inside that one-node DAG request. This is deliberate: the deterministic queue/drainer is proven first; per-family Restate cutovers remain Story 4 work.
7. On accepted Restate dispatch, the drainer acks the queue message; on failure it leaves the message in Redis, applies retry cooldown, and emits `queue.dispatch.failed` OTEL evidence.
8. If backlog remains in Redis but the drainer stops making progress past `QUEUE_DRAIN_STALL_AFTER_MS`, it emits `queue.drainer.stalled` and exits non-zero so k8s restarts `deployment/restate-worker`. That is the self-heal path for a wedged drainer inside an otherwise-running Bun process.
9. Crash recovery comes from the Redis stream + consumer-group replay path, not from vibes: restart the `restate-worker` pod, let `getUnacked()` reclaim the inflight entries, then drain resumes.

## Workload flow: `joelclaw workload run` → Redis → Restate DAG → execution

1. `joelclaw workload plan ... --stages-from <file>` can load an explicit stage DAG, validate unknown deps/self-deps/duplicates/cycles, and preserve per-stage acceptance gates.
2. `joelclaw workload run <plan-artifact>` normalizes the selected stage into the canonical `workload/requested` runtime request.
3. Queue admission writes the request into Redis, where the deterministic drainer forwards it into Restate as a `dagOrchestrator/{workflowId}/run/send` request.
4. `dagOrchestrator` executes dependency waves: ready nodes in parallel, chained nodes only after every `dependsOn` node has terminal output.
5. `dagWorker` executes the node handler:
   - `shell` → subprocess work inside the `restate-worker` pod
   - `infer` → `pi -p --no-session --no-extensions` inside the pod, using the mounted auth + identity + skill set
   - `microvm` → Firecracker boot/restore through `/dev/kvm` with kernel/rootfs/snapshot files on PVC `firecracker-images`
6. Each node emits OTEL (`dag.node.*`), and the workflow emits `dag.workflow.*` so queue → Restate → execution remains observable.
7. Current truthful limit: the microVM runtime boots and restores snapshots in-cluster, but the broader exec-in-VM workspace drive protocol is still incomplete for general coding slices.

## Webhook flow

1. External service posts to `/webhooks/:provider`.
2. Caddy routes `/webhooks/*` on `localhost:8443` to worker `localhost:3111`.
3. `webhookApp` verifies signature, normalizes payload, emits Inngest events (`provider/event`).
4. Inngest executes subscribed functions.

## "Why did this run / not run" trace recipe

1. Start with an existing event or run id. Send a probe only when its destination and effects are explicitly authorized.
2. `joelclaw events --prefix <event-prefix> --hours 1`
3. `joelclaw event <event-id>` (fan-out to function runs)
4. `joelclaw run <run-id>` (step trace + errors)
5. `joelclaw runs --count 20 --hours 1`
6. `joelclaw otel search "<component/action>" --hours 1`
7. Validate function ownership in `index.host.ts` / `index.cluster.ts`.

### Notes

- Host NodePort exposure appears through an `ssh` listener process (Colima portForwarder=ssh).
- Exact per-port ssh forward command line is **UNKNOWN — needs manual verification** (process introspection restricted in this environment).
- Numeric ports such as `6379`, `8108`, `8288`, `8289`, `8080`, `9070`, `9071`, `9000`, and `9001` can refer to Panda live k8s/NodePort surfaces or Flagg shadow Compose loopback surfaces depending on the host. Check `hostname`, `CENTRAL_BIND_ADDR`, `JOELCLAW_CENTRAL_URL`, and the current shell env before diagnosing.

## 6) Storage Topology

## Run blobs / memory capture

- Current dev source of truth: `~/.joelclaw/runs-dev/<user>/<yyyy-mm>/<run-id>.jsonl` plus `.metadata.json`.
- Capture identity is resolved locally by bearer-token hash from `~/.joelclaw/capture-auth.db`.
- `machines_dev` is the enrollment/migration mirror. A five-minute background sync propagates rotation and revocation without putting Typesense on the capture request path.
- Search projection: SQLite `sessions.db` for Run metadata, compact chunks, and FTS5.
- Failed Machine POSTs spool to `~/.joelclaw/outbox/`.
- Future/target contract from `CONTEXT.md`: Run blobs live on NAS and SQLite remains rebuildable from those blobs.

## Redis

- Runtime: k8s StatefulSet (`redis:7-alpine`, appendonly enabled).
- Primary uses:
  - gateway queue/session keys (`joelclaw:events:*`, `joelclaw:notify:*`, `joelclaw:gateway:sessions`)
  - webhook subscriptions (`joelclaw:webhook:*`)
  - gateway health mute/streak keys (`gateway:health:*`)

## Typesense

From current runtime code:

- The old `observations` and `brain_graph_nodes` recall collections are not production recall sources. `typesense-recall` remains registered only as the dated, visible degraded rollback adapter.
- `machines_dev` as the enrollment/migration mirror for the local capture-auth registry
- Flagg operational node: `/Users/Shared/joelclaw/data/typesense` on `127.0.0.1:8108`, owned by the system LaunchDaemon.
- Flagg book node: `~/.joelclaw/typesense-books/data` on `127.0.0.1:8110`, owned by the user LaunchAgent.
- `DOCS_TYPESENSE_URL` selects the book node for docs-api, docs ingest, `joelclaw docs`, and the book subset of unified search. `TYPESENSE_URL` remains the operational node.
- The book node holds only `docs` and `docs_chunks_v2`. Do not recreate these collections on the operational node after cutover.
- The exported JSONL and collection schemas under `~/.joelclaw/backups/typesense-books/` are the migration rollback source. Never copy a live Typesense data directory as a backup.

## Firecracker runtime storage

- PVC: `firecracker-images`
- Mounted in `deployment/restate-worker` at `/tmp/firecracker-test`
- Stores:
  - kernel (`vmlinux`)
  - rootfs (`agent-rootfs.ext4`)
  - snapshots (`snapshots/vm.snap`, `snapshots/vm.mem`)
- Firecracker snapshot restore is currently operator-proven at ~9ms on the Colima VZ nested-virt path.

## Inngest state

- StatefulSet PVC mounted at `/data`
- `INNGEST_SQLITE_DIR=/data`

## docs-api surface

- Deployment: `docs-api` on NodePort `3838`
- Route count: 11 endpoints including `/health`
- Key routes:
  - `GET /search` — hybrid chunk search with `concept`, `concepts`, `doc_id`, `expand`, and `assemble`
  - `GET /docs/search`
  - `GET /docs`
  - `GET /docs/:id`
  - `GET /docs/:id/toc`
  - `GET /docs/:id/chunks`
  - `GET /chunks/:id`
  - `GET /concepts`
  - `GET /concepts/:id`
  - `GET /concepts/:id/docs`
- Taxonomy surface: 21-concept SKOS graph (10 parents + 11 sub-concepts) with `broader`, `narrower`, and `related` edges.

## NAS (ADR-0088 + ADR-0187)

Tiering policy:

- Tier 1 local SSD (hot runtime state)
- Tier 2 NAS NVMe (`/Volumes/nas-nvme` ↔ `/volume2/data`)
- Tier 3 NAS HDD (`/Volumes/three-body`)

### Access paths

| From              | NVMe tier (1.5TB)   | HDD tier (56TB)       | Method                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| macOS host        | `/Volumes/nas-nvme` | `/Volumes/three-body` | NFS mount via LaunchDaemon  |
| k8s pods          | PVC `nas-nvme`      | PVC `nas-hdd`         | NFS PV (192.168.1.163)      |
| host-worker funcs | `/Volumes/nas-nvme` | `/Volumes/three-body` | Direct path (runs on macOS) |

### k8s ↔ NAS networking

k8s pods reach the NAS via a LAN route through the Colima col0 bridge:
`Talos → Docker NAT → VM col0 → macOS (ip.forwarding=1) → LAN → NAS`

The VZ NAT on eth0 does NOT forward LAN traffic. Route persisted in Colima provision + colima-tunnel script:
`ip route replace 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.64.1 dev col0`

**Always use IP 192.168.1.163, never hostname three-body** — DNS doesn't resolve from k8s.

Degradation contract (ADR-0187):

- writes must fallback `local -> remote -> queued`
- queue spool default: `/tmp/joelclaw/nas-queue`

## Flagg Central shadow storage

- Service root: `/Users/Shared/joelclaw/`
- Shadow service data:
  - Redis: `/Users/Shared/joelclaw/services/redis`
  - Typesense: `/Users/Shared/joelclaw/services/typesense`
  - Inngest: `/Users/Shared/joelclaw/services/inngest`
  - MinIO smoke data: `/Users/Shared/joelclaw/services/minio`
  - Restate: Docker named volume `${CENTRAL_RESTATE_VOLUME:-joelclaw-central-restate-data}` because macOS/Colima bind mounts reject Restate's Unix socket writes under `/restate-data`
- Flagg NAS object-storage proof paths:
  - hot: `/Volumes/nas-nvme/s3`
  - cold: `/Volumes/three-body/s3`
- Current proved NAS route:
  - Flagg interface `en0`, IP `192.168.1.10`, `10Gbase-T`
  - `three-body` IP `192.168.1.163`
  - MTU `1500` is the proved safe Gate 5 state; jumbo `9000` caused an NFS blackhole and is follow-up work.
- `CENTRAL_REQUIRE_NAS=1` should only be set after mount proof passes.

## Rhizomatic / Chorus (parked historical canary)

- Decision: parked on 2026-07-17. It does not inject session briefings and no real claims may land.
- The Brain is the only memory substrate. Any future claim graph must be a Brain-owned projection.
- Historical artifacts remain at the old Flagg service/checkout/store paths only for cleanup and provenance.
- `com.joelclaw.chorus-rhizomatic` shutdown still requires the steering sudo step; a loaded process does not make it an active dependency.
- Old `4821`/`7331` endpoints and tunnels are not live routing guidance.

## Vault and durable receipts

- Obsidian vault at `/Users/joel/Vault`
- Durable project/system receipts belong in Brain `.svx`.
- The former `/Users/joel/Vault/system/system-log.jsonl` journal is archived and retired; runtime telemetry is canonical OTel in Typesense/ClickHouse.

---

## 7) Networking Topology

## Central / Relay / Satellite routing rule

- Live Central URL for capture hooks today: `https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net`.
- Satellites post Run capture to `/api/runs` on that URL and may use `JOELCLAW_TYPESENSE_URL=http://panda:8108` for direct search/admin helpers.
- Flagg shadow services bind to `127.0.0.1` by default and must not be exposed over Tailscale/LAN until cutover planning says so.
- There is no live Rhizomatic/Chorus routing exception. The old Flagg service and satellite tunnels are parked historical cleanup surfaces.

## Caddy reverse proxy routes (from `~/.local/caddy/Caddyfile`)

- `https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net:9443` -> `localhost:8288` (Inngest)
- `https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net:8290` -> `localhost:8289` (Inngest connect)
- `https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net:3443` -> `localhost:3111` (worker)
- `https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net:5443` -> `localhost:3838` (docs-api)
- `https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net:7443` -> `localhost:7880` (LiveKit)
- `https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net:6443` -> `localhost:6333` (Qdrant)
- `http://localhost:8443` path router:
  - `/webhooks/*` -> `localhost:3111`
  - fallback -> `localhost:8288`

## Tailscale + Funnel

- Config comments and ADR-0051 describe Funnel path `:443 -> localhost:8443`.
- Runtime `tailscale status` unavailable here: **UNKNOWN — needs manual verification**.

## External webhook ingress

Expected path:

1. Internet provider -> Tailscale Funnel :443
2. Funnel -> local `:8443`
3. Caddy path route `/webhooks/*` -> worker `:3111`
4. worker `/webhooks/:provider` verifies + emits Inngest event

## Run capture ingress

Expected path:

1. Machine hook reads `JOELCLAW_CENTRAL_URL` (satellite setup exports `https://panda.tail7af24.ts.net`)
2. hook sends `POST /api/runs` with bearer token from `~/.joelclaw/auth.json`
3. Tailscale/Funnel/Caddy path reaches Panda host worker `localhost:3111`
4. worker writes Run blob and emits `memory/run.captured`

Primary command tree root: `packages/cli/src/cli.ts`.

## Endpoint map by command family

Run capture is currently hook/script-driven, not a normal operator command family:

- Claude Code: `scripts/joelclaw-capture-session.ts`
- Codex: `scripts/joelclaw-capture-codex-session.js`
- Pi: runtime extension hook
- Central endpoint: `POST /api/runs`

Config source:

- `~/.config/system-bus.env` (plus env overrides)
- defaults:
  - `INNGEST_URL=http://localhost:8288`
  - `INNGEST_WORKER_URL=http://localhost:3111`

---

## 9) Observability + Tracing Topology

## OTEL event pipeline

- Worker emits via `emitOtelEvent()` / `emitMeasuredOtelEvent()`.
- Gateway emits via `@joelclaw/telemetry` (`emitGatewayOtel`) to:
  - default `OTEL_EMIT_URL=http://localhost:3111/observability/emit`
- Worker endpoint `/observability/emit` validates token (`x-otel-emit-token`) if configured.
- Store path (`storeOtelEvent`):
  1. ClickHouse through the OTEL collector
  2. optional Convex mirror for high-severity recent window
  3. optional Sentry forward for `warn/error/fatal`

## Run/session search observability

- `joelclaw sessions search` is an operator bridge, not a new source of truth.
- SQLite `sessions.db` searches captured Run chunks when the compacted index is current.
- Raw fallback searches Pi session JSONL locally or over SSH when SQLite is stale or missing.
- `--extract` returns bounded task context with decisions, commands, files, receipts, verification, blockers, next actions, and transcript line pointers. Do not dump whole transcripts.
- If raw blobs/session files are newer than SQLite, fix indexing or backfill from blobs; do not treat the missing search hit as proof the work never happened.

## Talon / health alerting posture

- Talon should page for actionable critical failures, not normal control-plane taints or repeated noise from the same underlying outage.
- Recent hardening adds critical-probe debounce and SOS throttling.
- System worker supervision is a Panda system LaunchDaemon path; Talon checks must inspect `system/com.joel.system-bus-worker`, not only the user bootstrap domain.
- Agent Secrets health should prefer `secrets status`; `secrets health` can time out under load and false-negative while leases still work.

## Langfuse integration points

- Gateway boot: `packages/gateway/src/daemon.ts` calls `initTracing({})` from inference-router.
- Inference router traces model-route decisions:
  - `packages/inference-router/src/tracing.ts`
  - used from `packages/inference-router/src/router.ts`
- System-bus LLM traces:
  - `packages/system-bus/src/lib/pi-output.ts` (`traceLlmGeneration`)
  - called by `packages/system-bus/src/lib/inference.ts` and `channel-message-classify.ts`

## 10.1) Sandbox Execution Contract (@joelclaw/agent-execution)

**Package**: `packages/agent-execution/`  
**Purpose**: Canonical contract for sandboxed story execution shared between Restate workflows, system-bus Inngest functions, and k8s Job launcher.

### Contract Types

**Request**: `SandboxExecutionRequest`

- `workflowId`, `requestId`, `storyId`: identifiers
- `task`: story prompt/task to execute
- `agent`: `{ name, variant?, model?, program? }`
- `sandbox`: `"workspace-write" | "danger-full-access"`
- `baseSha`: git SHA before execution
- `cwd?`: working directory
- `timeoutSeconds?`: timeout
- `verificationCommands?`: post-execution verification
- `sessionId?`: tracking identifier

**Result**: `SandboxExecutionResult`

- `requestId`: correlation ID
- `state`: `"pending" | "running" | "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled"`
- `startedAt`, `completedAt?`, `durationMs?`: timing
- `artifacts?`: execution artifacts (see below)
- `error?`: error message (failed state)
- `output?`: stdout/stderr output

**Artifacts**: `ExecutionArtifacts`

- `headSha`: git SHA after execution
- `touchedFiles`: list of modified/untracked files from `git status --porcelain`
- `patch?`: git patch content (format-patch or diff)
- `verification?`: `{ commands, success, output }`
- `logs?`: `{ executionLog?, verificationLog? }`

### Repo Materialization (Story 3)

**Function**: `materializeRepo(targetPath, baseSha, options)`

**Behavior**:

- Clone repo if target path doesn't exist (requires `remoteUrl`)
- Fetch + checkout if target path exists
- SHA verification after checkout
- Automatic unshallow if SHA not in shallow clone
- Isolated sandbox-local workspace (host worktree untouched)

**Returns**: `{ path, sha, freshClone, durationMs }`

**Key options**:

- `remoteUrl?`: remote URL for fresh clone
- `branch?`: branch/ref to fetch (default: `"main"`)
- `depth?`: shallow clone depth (default: `1`)
- `includeSubmodules?`: include submodules
- `timeoutSeconds?`: timeout (default: `300`)

### Artifact Export (Story 3)

**Function**: `generatePatchArtifact(options)`

**Behavior**:

- Captures touched-file inventory via `getTouchedFiles()`
- Generates git patch from `baseSha..headSha`:
  - Uses `git format-patch` if commits exist in range
  - Uses `git diff` if only uncommitted changes
- Optionally includes untracked files as patch content
- Embeds verification summary and log references
- Serializable to JSON via `writeArtifactBundle()`

**Key options**:

- `repoPath`: path to git repo
- `baseSha`: base SHA (start of diff range)
- `headSha?`: head SHA (default: HEAD)
- `includeUntracked?`: include untracked files (default: `true`)
- `verificationCommands?`, `verificationSuccess?`, `verificationOutput?`: verification data
- `executionLogPath?`, `verificationLogPath?`: log references
- `timeoutSeconds?`: timeout (default: `60`)

**Returns**: `ExecutionArtifacts`

### Promotion Boundary (Phase 1)

**Authoritative output is patch bundle + metadata.**

Sandbox runs **do not** merge to main or push to remote. The runtime:

1. Materializes repo at `baseSha` in sandbox-local workspace
2. Executes agent task
3. Runs verification commands
4. Exports patch artifact with touched files and verification results
5. Emits `SandboxExecutionResult` event with `ExecutionArtifacts`

Promotion is a separate operator decision:

- Restate workflow receives `ExecutionArtifacts`
- Operator reviews patch + verification summary
- Operator applies patch to host repo (or discards)
- Operator commits and pushes (if approved)

This keeps sandbox runs isolated and reversible.

### k8s Job Integration

**Job spec generation**: `generateJobSpec(request, options)`

Cold k8s Jobs for isolated story execution:

- Deterministic Job naming keyed by `requestId`
- Runtime image contract: Git, Bun, agent tooling, `/workspace` directory
- Environment-driven config: `WORKFLOW_ID`, `REQUEST_ID`, `STORY_ID`, `TASK_PROMPT_B64`, `BASE_SHA`, etc.
- Resource limits: `500m-2` CPU, `1-4Gi` memory (configurable)
- TTL cleanup: auto-delete after 5 minutes (default)
- Active deadline: 1 hour max runtime (default)
- No automatic retries (`backoffLimit: 0`)
- Security: non-root (UID 1000), no privilege escalation, capabilities dropped

**Runtime contract**:

1. Decode `TASK_PROMPT_B64` from env
2. Call `materializeRepo()` at `BASE_SHA`
3. Execute agent with task
4. Run verification commands (if `VERIFICATION_COMMANDS_B64` set)
5. Call `generatePatchArtifact()` with results
6. Emit `SandboxExecutionResult` event with `ExecutionArtifacts`
7. Exit 0 (success) or non-zero (failure)

**Cancellation**: Delete Job resource (SIGTERM to container)

**Job deletion**: `generateJobDeletion(requestId)` -> `{ name, namespace, propagationPolicy }`

See `k8s/agent-runner.yaml` for full runtime contract specification.

### Topology Impact

- **Story 2**: Added contract types and Job spec generation
- **Story 3**: Added repo materialization and artifact export helpers
- **ADR-0221 phase 1**: added explicit local sandbox isolation primitives — deterministic sandbox identity, deterministic local sandbox paths, per-sandbox env materialization, minimal/full mode vocabulary, and a JSON registry helper for host-worker sandboxes
- **ADR-0221 phase 2**: wired those local helpers into the real host-worker `system/agent-dispatch` local backend so sandbox runs now allocate deterministic paths under `~/.joelclaw/sandboxes/`, materialize `.sandbox.env`, persist registry state, and carry `localSandbox` metadata in inbox snapshots
- **ADR-0221 phase 3/4/5/6**: phase 3 added terminal retention/cleanup policy (`cleanupAfter` + registry metadata), opportunistic pruning of expired local sandboxes on new-run startup, copy-first `.devcontainer` materialization helpers with exclusion rules for env/secret junk, live sandbox env injection so the agent process actually sees the reserved runtime identity, a hash-preserving sandbox identity fix after live dogfood exposed path collisions from long shared requestId prefixes, abbreviated-`baseSha` acceptance during repo materialization, truthful failed inbox snapshots when dispatch crashes before normal terminal writeback, and a repeatable operator probe at `bun scripts/verify-local-sandbox-dispatch.ts`; phase 4 adds `sandboxMode=minimal|full` through the workload front door, requested-cwd mapping inside the cloned checkout, compose-backed full local mode startup, the reality that stale Restate workers can reject `workload/requested` until restarted and reloaded, a recursion guard because sandboxed stage runs were able to call `scripts/verify-workload-full-mode.ts` / `joelclaw workload run` from inside the sandbox and spawn nested canaries instead of terminating honestly, and a guarded workflow-rig proof run (`WR_20260310_013158`) that completes terminally with healthy compose startup plus clean teardown; phase 5 adds the operator-facing CLI surface `joelclaw workload sandboxes list|cleanup|janitor` so retained sandboxes can be inspected and janitored on demand instead of only during startup opportunistic pruning, and the operator surfaces now reconcile registry entries against per-sandbox metadata before reporting or deleting so old partial writeback residue stops lying about terminal state; phase 6 makes janitoring scheduled instead of purely manual via repo-managed launchd service `com.joel.local-sandbox-janitor`, which runs `scripts/local-sandbox-janitor.sh` → `joelclaw workload sandboxes janitor` at load and every 30 minutes
- **Future**: Runtime image build, hot-image CronJob, warm-pool scheduler, Restate integration

**Current state**: the host-worker local sandbox path is now using the local-isolation helpers in production code, the package has a concurrent proof that two local sandboxes keep distinct compose identity plus copied devcontainer state, guarded full-mode workflow-rig dogfood closes terminally, and cleanup now has both on-demand CLI surfaces and scheduled launchd janitoring. Follow-on work is now about deeper runtime ergonomics and debugging any remaining non-terminal stale residues, not missing basic cleanup automation.

## 11) Verification Commands (Health + Wiring)

## Core topology

```bash
# Colima + VM IP
colima status --json

# Kubernetes control plane + node
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes -o wide

# Core workloads
kubectl get pods -n joelclaw -o wide
kubectl get svc -n joelclaw -o wide
```

## Host supervision

```bash
# Worker supervisor launchd state
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.joel.system-bus-worker | rg "state =|pid =|last exit code"

# Gateway / Caddy / Talon
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.joel.gateway | rg "state =|pid ="
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.joel.caddy | rg "state =|pid ="
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.joel.talon | rg "state =|pid ="

# Talon health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9999/health
```

## Worker role split

```bash
# Parse role counts directly from source lists
python - <<'PY'
import re
from pathlib import Path
for f,name in [('packages/system-bus/src/inngest/functions/index.host.ts','host'),('packages/system-bus/src/inngest/functions/index.cluster.ts','cluster')]:
    txt=Path(f).read_text()
    body=re.search(rf'export const {name}FunctionDefinitions = \[(.*?)\];', txt, re.S).group(1)
    count=sum(1 for line in body.splitlines() if line.strip() and not line.strip().startswith('//'))
    print(name, count)
PY

# Inngest app ID derivation logic
rg -n "INNGEST_APP_ID|system-bus-host|system-bus-cluster|WORKER_ROLE" packages/system-bus/src/inngest/client.ts
```

## Event flow trace

```bash
# Send event
joelclaw send <event> -d '<json>'

# Trace event and resulting runs
joelclaw events --prefix <event-prefix> --hours 1 --count 20
joelclaw event <event-id>
joelclaw runs --hours 1 --count 20
joelclaw run <run-id>

# Telemetry correlation
joelclaw otel search "<component_or_action>" --hours 1
```

## Run capture + session search

Use `recall` and the current `session-search` contract. Keep private queries in structured MCP arguments. Raw evidence requires a scope-bound `evidenceDrilldownReceipt`; missing projections do not grant raw access.

## Flagg Central shadow

```bash
cd ~/Code/joelhooks/joelclaw
./infra/central/scripts/preflight.sh
./infra/central/scripts/health.sh
ssh joel@flagg 'cd /Users/Shared/joelclaw/src/joelclaw && ./infra/central/scripts/reboot-proof.sh'

# NAS proof when explicitly working Gate 5 storage
sudo -u joelclaw -H env NAS_EXPECTED_INTERFACE=en0 NAS_EXPECTED_MTU=1500 \
  ./infra/central/scripts/verify-nas.sh --write-probe --benchmark-mib 64
```

## Rhizomatic / Chorus parked-state check

```bash
# Historical cleanup only: confirm whether the parked service still awaits steering sudo.
launchctl print system/com.joelclaw.chorus-rhizomatic | rg "state =|pid =|last exit code"
```

Do not health-check or restart Chorus as a live memory substrate. There is no session briefing injection and no real claims may land.

## Networking

```bash
# Caddy route config
caddy validate --config ~/.local/caddy/Caddyfile

# Listening ports snapshot
/usr/sbin/lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P

# Tailscale runtime (if daemon available)
tailscale status --json
```

---

## 12) Known Unknowns (Do Not Guess)

- Tailscale daemon state is not readable in this environment.
  - `tailscale status --json` -> failed to connect.
  - **UNKNOWN — needs manual verification**
- Live Flagg Central LaunchDaemon state is not implied by repo templates.
  - Check `/Library/LaunchDaemons`, `launchctl print system/<label>`, and `infra/central/scripts/health.sh`.
  - **UNKNOWN until verified on Flagg**
- Typesense session search can be stale or missing expected collections while raw session files / Run blobs exist.
  - Diagnose capture and index metadata before declaring memory lost. Raw search and extraction require the scope-bound evidence receipt.
- Exact command-line ownership of all Colima ssh forwarding ports (`64784`, `64785`, `9627`, etc.)
  - **UNKNOWN — needs manual verification**
- Ingress controller runtime status for `k8s/docs-api-ingress.yaml`
  - **UNKNOWN — needs manual verification**
- Whether `docs/observability.md` has fully caught up with Talon/Run-capture hardening.
  - **UNKNOWN — needs manual verification**
