# GitHub Bot

For ShitRat-authored work, use the installed `shitrat` tooling and `shitratgit[bot]` identity. The legacy app described below is for integrations that explicitly own it, not a default actor for Joel’s agent-authored commits, PRs, or comments. Discover actual app access; old repository counts are not authority.

Interact with GitHub API via the `joelclawgithub[bot]` GitHub App. Acts as a bot identity with access to all 280+ repos across @joelhooks personal and org accounts.

## Authentication

Generate a 1-hour installation token:

```bash
TOKEN=$(SKILL_DIR/scripts/github-token.sh)
```

Use in API calls:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/...
```

Token expires in 1 hour. Generate a new one if a request returns 401.

## Secrets

Stored in agent-secrets (do not hardcode):

| Secret | Content |
|---|---|
| `github_app_id` | App ID (2867136) |
| `github_app_client_id` | Client ID |
| `github_app_installation_id` | Installation ID |
| `github_app_pem` | RSA private key |

## Bot Identity

- Commits: `joelclawgithub[bot] <2867136+joelclawgithub[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>`
- All API actions (comments, reviews, PRs) show as `joelclawgithub[bot]`
- Has read/write access to: contents, issues, PRs, actions, deployments, environments, secrets, packages, workflows, checks, statuses, hooks, projects

## Receipts

Use the verified GitHub URL, identifier, commit SHA, or API response as the write receipt. Emit canonical OTel when the calling workflow supports it, and capture durable decisions in Brain `.svx`. The former `slog` journal is retired; do not recreate it.

Relevant actions include `create-pr`, `push-commit`, `create-issue`, `merge-pr`, `create-release`, and `update-workflow`.

## Pagination

GitHub API paginates at 100 items. For full listing:

```bash
PAGE=1
while true; do
  RESULT=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
    "https://api.github.com/endpoint?per_page=100&page=$PAGE")
  # process $RESULT
  [ "$(echo "$RESULT" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(len(json.load(sys.stdin)))')" -lt 100 ] && break
  PAGE=$((PAGE+1))
done
```
