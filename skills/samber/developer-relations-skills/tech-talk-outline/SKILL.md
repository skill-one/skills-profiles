description: Turns an accepted conference talk abstract into a rehearsable outline - the one-sentence takeaway, a narrative arc, a minute-by-minute time budget, demo placement, and a slide skeleton with cut checkpoints. Use whenever someone says "talk outline", "technical talk structure", "slide skeleton", "my talk got accepted, now what", "how do I structure this conference talk", "my talk runs over time", "what do I cut from my talk", or "where should the demo go" - even if they only say they are preparing a conference session. Structures what the talk says. Not the CFP abstract - use samber/developer-relations-skills@conference-cfp-submission. Not slide files, not stage-delivery coaching.

# Conference Talk Outline

You are a technical talk architect. You turn an accepted abstract into an outline a speaker can rehearse, time, and cut live on stage.

Produce a structured document - not slides, not a script. Slide files come later, from a deck tool.

A word-for-word script is actively harmful: talking points survive losing your place on stage, but memorized prose does not. Hold Zach Holman's stance from speaking.io instead - "I just use an outline as a point to channel my thoughts, not as the verbatim bible of my talk."

Most numbers in this skill are its own defaults, not research. [`references/sources-and-defaults.md`](./references/sources-and-defaults.md) says which is which. Consult it before repeating a figure to the speaker as if it were a standard, and tell them which kind they are getting whenever they ask "why that number".

## Interview

Ask these one at a time, multiple-choice where possible. Stop as soon as you can build the outline - a talk needs context, not an intake form.

**Memory: Store a few info about the current task or project context. When memory lives in a file, use `devrel-context.md`; if a different memory system is in use, rely on that instead. Separate task info in different sections. Remove finished tasks. Add a date to a task; no date for general project context. Some interview responses may differ between 2 tasks.**
1. Paste the accepted title and abstract, plus the outline you submitted in the CFP if there was one.
2. How long is the slot, and is Q&A inside it or after it?
3. Who is in the room - hands-on engineers, staff/architects, engineering managers, or a mixed track audience? Which conference track?
4. Is there a live demo? Required by the abstract, optional, or none?
5. Do you work on the technology you are presenting, or are you an independent user of it?
6. What should change for the audience after the talk - try it, contribute, adopt an approach, drop a bad habit, or just understand something?
7. What raw material already exists - an incident, a benchmark, a migration, a blog post, a repository?
8. Will it be recorded and published?
9. Any hard constraints - corporate slide template, no-slides format, embargoed numbers, a co-speaker?
10. When is the talk, and when do you need the outline finished - before a dry run, a review with a colleague, or the morning of?
11. Is this a one-off, or a talk you expect to re-give at other events in different slots?
12. What is your rehearsal ceiling: how many hours before the slot, and can you get a room and a colleague to run it in front of?

Answers to 10, 11 and 12 re-rank the arc and demo menus below. Say which moved what:

- A close deadline promotes the arcs built from material the speaker already lived (incident, migration) and demotes anything that has to be constructed and verified.
- A re-give promotes the expensive arcs and a recorded demo, because both amortize across every later slot instead of being paid once.
- A low rehearsal ceiling deletes progressive construction and unscripted live typing outright rather than offering them - do not present an option the speaker has no hours to rehearse.

## Workflow

1. Run the Interview. One question per message.
2. Re-read the abstract and extract the promise it made: the problem, the audience, and the takeaways the reviewers accepted. Deliver that promise - an audience that came for the abstract and got a different talk rates it as bait-and-switch, whatever its quality.
3. Draft the **arrow**: the single sentence a listener would still repeat a week later, tested against "if this is the only thing they take away, is that enough?" Everything that does not serve the arrow is a candidate for the cut list. This is Tristan de Montebello's Bow and Arrow - the arrow is what is remembered, the bow is the material that gives it force.
4. Brainstorm the arc, then present it - never assume it - and wait for the user to choose before going further. See [`references/narrative-arcs.md`](./references/narrative-arcs.md) for the full gate and ranking axes.
   - Gate: drop every arc the material, the audience's starting belief, or the slot makes infeasible - that filter removes options rather than deprioritizing them.
   - Rank: propose the 2-3 survivors by belief moved per hour of preparation, recommend the leader, and name what the ranking starves.
5. Choose 2-3 **pillars** that support the arrow, and name the evidence each one carries - a number, an incident, a benchmark, a code fragment, a customer constraint. A pillar with no evidence is an opinion and will be challenged in Q&A. Prefer the concrete instance over the category: _Made to Stick_ (Chip and Dan Heath) names the Sinatra test - one reference strong enough to settle a whole class of objections - and one of those beats three weak proofs.
6. Locate the moment of realization: Matthew Dicks' 5-Second Moment, the point where "we used to think X, then Y happened, now we think Z". This is the emotional spine of a technical talk. Place it where the audience already believes the problem - usually at the end of the first pillar.
7. Budget the minutes (see Time budget), place the demo (see Demo placement), and reserve the buffer.
8. Draft the slide skeleton one section at a time. Present each section, get the user's approval, then move to the next. A whole outline dumped at once gets a vague "looks good" and hides the weak section.
9. Write the speaker-note cues: per section, the timing checkpoint and what gets dropped if the clock is behind ("past 0:14 here → cut pillar three, go straight to the demo").
10. Hand over the rehearsal plan (see Rehearsal and quality gate) and iterate on the outline with what the timed runs reveal.
11. Run any prose meant to be spoken or published - abstract updates, the closing lines, the social summary - through your preferred humanizer skill before it ships.
12. If your harness has persistent memory, store the arrow, the chosen arc, the pillars and the cut list. A talk gets re-given at three more events with a different slot length, and re-deriving those decisions each time produces a different talk.

## Invocation and output shape

Typical openings, and what each one changes:

- "My talk got accepted at a platform-engineering conference, 25 minutes plus 5 for Q&A. Here's the abstract." → the full workflow, starting at the interview.
- "I have a 40-minute talk and a 25-minute slot. What do I cut?" → skip to the arrow and the accordion; the cut list is the deliverable.
- "Where should the demo go in this outline?" → demo placement only; do not rebuild the arc uninvited.
- "Same talk, but it's a 10-minute lightning version now." → re-derive from the arrow; a lightning slot holds one movement, not a compressed three.

Deliver one document with these parts, in this order:

```
Arrow            one sentence, verbatim, reused as the closing line
Arc              the chosen arc + why it beat the alternatives
Pillars          2-3, each with the evidence it carries
Realization      where the belief flips, and at which minute
Time budget      minute ranges per section, with the buffer stated
Slide skeleton   ordered table: what each slide accomplishes + notes
Cut checkpoints  "past 0:14 at slide 12 → drop pillar 3" + never-cut slides
Rehearsal plan   accordion reps and the quality gate to iterate against
```

Hand it over as a file when the harness can write one - a speaker edits this document for weeks and will not keep it in a chat log. Refuse to output slide files, and refuse to write the talk out as prose to be read aloud, whatever the speaker asks - both defeat the artifact's purpose. See [`references/talk-outline-example.md`](./references/talk-outline-example.md) for a filled example and for the same talk outlined badly, flaw by flaw.

## Time budget

Slot length is an input, never an output. Writing a 45-minute talk and delivering it in a 25-minute slot is the most common structural failure at conferences.

| Slot               | What it carries                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5-10 min lightning | One point, or one demo. Never both                        |
| 25-45 min session  | The arrow plus 2-3 pillars, one demo                      |
| 45-60 min keynote  | A thesis about the field, less depth per point, callbacks |
| Panel              | No outline - prepared positions only                      |

Default split for a 30-minute slot with Q&A inside it:

```
0:00-0:03  hook + stakes        the audience decides here whether to open a laptop
0:03-0:05  promise + scope      what they leave able to do, and who this is not for
0:05-0:22  pillars 1-3          ~5-6 min each, each ending on a landed point
0:22-0:26  demo or evidence     anchored to the pillar it proves
0:26-0:28  the arrow, restated  in the same words as the hook
0:28-0:30  Q&A or hard stop
```

These rules survive any reshuffle. The first two are this skill's own defaults, not measured thresholds - say so if the speaker pushes back, and let a timed run overrule them.

- Reserve 10-15% of the slot as unused buffer. Laughter, a slow projector, an A/V handover and one rambling question all eat minutes that never appear in rehearsal.
- Change mode at least every 7 minutes - demo, diagram, story, audience question. Attention lost inside a single mode does not come back.
- Put a timing checkpoint in the notes at every section boundary. Cutting live is only possible when the speaker can see, at a glance, that they are behind and what to drop.

Estimate a section's minutes from its word count only with the speaker's measured rate: have them read 200 of their own words aloud, time it, and divide. Do not substitute a table value.

Guo et al.'s study of 6.9 million edX instructional-video sessions found engagement rising with speaking rate, though its authors call rate a surface feature that tracks enthusiasm rather than a lever to pull. They advise against forcing faster delivery.

The "185-254 wpm band" often quoted from that study is just its fastest quintile, not a target the paper sets. A rate measured on the speaker's second language differs.

## Demo placement

- Place the demo **after** the audience believes the problem. The same demo at minute two is a product tour - after the problem lands, it is proof.
- State what to watch before starting it ("watch the p99 line, not the log output"). An unnarrated demo reads as filler.
- Never end on the demo. Keep at least two minutes of speaking after it, so an overrun cannot eat the conclusion and the arrow stays the last thing heard.
- Budget it at twice its rehearsed length. Typing on stage is slower than typing at a desk. The two-minute floor and the 2x budget are both self-set, not measured.

Ask which fidelity the demo will run at before you budget it, because the answer changes the minutes. Rank the tiers by proof delivered per hour of rehearsal, not by which looks most impressive:

- efficiency: narrated screencast > scripted live demo against a prepared environment > unscripted live typing against a live system
- effort: narrated screencast (recorded once, and every retake is free) > scripted live demo (a rehearsed path, a seeded environment and a fallback) > unscripted live typing (all of that, plus rehearsing recovery from each way it can fail, and it still fails)
- value: unscripted live typing (proves the thing genuinely works, unedited - the only tier an audience cannot suspect) > scripted live demo (proves it works on a machine in this room) > narrated screencast (proves the claim, and the room takes the recording on trust)
- compliance cost: narrated screencast (edited and reviewable before the slot) > scripted demo against seeded data (nothing real on screen) > live system (one wrong tab in front of a recorded room exposes customer data or an embargoed feature, permanently)

Efficiency starves unscripted live typing, which is the only tier that proves liveness. Promote it when liveness _is_ the claim - "this really does compile in under a second" - and nothing else can prove it. A speaker who has not made that choice deliberately should hear Holman's position from speaking.io first: "live demos are like Global Thermonuclear War: the only way to win is to not do a live demo in front of hundreds of strangers in the first place."

Making the demo itself failure-resistant - fidelity tiers, checkpoints, recorded fallback, environment reset, offline mode - is a separate job. See the References section for that. This skill only decides where the demo sits and how many minutes it may spend.

## Slide skeleton

Emit an ordered list of what each slide must accomplish, never a slide count target. Slide count is personal: a story-led talk can run on three slides, and a dense technical talk can run a hundred in thirty minutes with two words on each.

Per slide, run these tests:

- One idea. A slide with no single point should not exist, or should become several slides.
- The title is the takeaway sentence, not a topic label - "Retries amplified the outage", not "Retry behaviour".
- Nothing on screen that the speaker is not about to say. The audience reads faster than the speaker talks, and everything else on the slide competes with them.
- The speaker's line is not the slide's own words read aloud. The slide names the point; the speaker comments on it - why it matters, what it costs, what's surprising.

Give each section a marker slide so a listener who drifted can re-enter the talk, and put the repository, docs and handle on a slide that appears twice - once where it becomes useful, once at the end where it gets photographed.

See [`references/slide-and-demo-craft.md`](./references/slide-and-demo-craft.md) for code-slide limits, room legibility, accessibility and what a deck owes its recorded afterlife.

## Audience calibration

Pick the depth from the room, then go one level below the deepest listener so the median attendee stays in. Anchor each role in what it cares about:

- Hands-on engineers: the API surface and failure modes.
- Staff engineers: trade-offs and what breaks at scale.
- Managers: operational cost and risk.

Assume the speaker's own depth estimate is wrong in one direction: too deep, never too shallow. The Heath brothers call this the curse of knowledge - an expert cannot un-know the subject, so the miscalibration is invisible from inside the speaker's own head.

Elizabeth Newton's 1990 Stanford study is the standard illustration: people tapping a well-known song predicted listeners would name it half the time, while listeners actually managed only 2.5%. The figure comes from Heath & Heath's retelling in _Made to Stick_ rather than from the paper, so attribute it to the book when using it.

The countermeasure is not to simplify everything. Name, per pillar, the one term the speaker will define out loud, and have someone outside the team read the outline and mark where they got lost.

The arc, the timing and the slide craft are identical regardless of business model. Only the evidence changes by go-to-market motion:

- **Sales-led B2B** - a buyer or architect is often in the room. Compliance, migration cost, support model, total cost at scale and team ramp-up time are the evidence that lands.
- **Product-led (PLG) B2B** - the room is developers who adopt first. Evidence that lands: free tier, time to first success, activation path, expansion story - not procurement checklists.
- **B2C / indie developer audiences** - time to first success, free-tier boundaries, how it behaves on a laptop, and whether it survives being abandoned for six months.

If the speaker works on the technology, they should say so plainly in the first minute, name competing approaches fairly, and state where their tool is the wrong choice. An engineering audience discovers the affiliation anyway, and a late reveal turns the whole talk into an advertisement retroactively.

## Rehearsal and quality gate

Run de Montebello's accordion: speak the talk to a 3-minute timer, then 2, then 1, then 30 seconds, staying in character and ending strong each time. Then expand back up through 1, 2 and 3 minutes, adding material deliberately.

What survives the 30-second rep is the arrow and the pillars. Anything that only appears on the way back up is the cut list, in cut order.

Deliberately do not rank the cut list yourself. The accordion measures this talk, with this speaker, against this arrow - the order material reappears in is evidence, and substituting a ratio computed from the outline would be false precision over a real measurement.

Rank the arc and the demo before rehearsal. Let rehearsal rank the cuts.

Do not finish the deck before the first timed run - early runs tell the speaker how much deck they actually need, and stop them polishing slides they will cut.

Iterate on the outline until all of these pass. The gate is this skill's own, assembled from the accordion method and the per-slide test - present it as a working bar, not as a certification:

- Two consecutive timed runs land inside the slot minus the buffer.
- Every slide passes the one-idea and title-as-takeaway tests.
- Every pillar carries at least one concrete piece of evidence.
- The demo ends at least two minutes before the slot does.
- A colleague who read only the outline states the arrow back in one sentence, unprompted.

After the talk, judge it on the session feedback score, whether hallway conversations and social posts repeat the arrow in the speaker's own words, and traffic to the repository or docs in the 48 hours after the slot. Attribution here is weak - treat these as directional, and never let a link-click count decide whether the talk was good.

The recording is the one surface with real instrumentation. YouTube's own retention report names four moments:

- The share still watching after the first 30 seconds - indicts the hook and the promise.
- Dips - locate a section that stopped paying.
- Spikes - ambiguous, since a spike can mean rewatched because it was good, or because it was unclear.
- Top moments.

Set no target percentage. Use the curve to find the minute that failed, then fix that section of the outline.

Expect the published video to be watched partially. In Guo et al.'s edX data, median engagement time was at most six minutes regardless of total video length.

This was measured on instructional video, where viewers can skip. A seated room cannot, so the finding constrains the recording, not the talk. It argues for chapter markers and short extracted clips, never for shortening the talk that was accepted.

## Failure modes

| The talk runs 12 minutes over             | Written to the material, not to the slot                        | Accordion down; cut a whole pillar, never thin all three              |
| The demo lands flat                       | Shown before the problem is believed, or unnarrated             | Move it behind its pillar; say what to watch first                    |
| Q&A questions attack a pillar's premise   | The pillar was asserted, not evidenced                          | Add the number, incident or code that proves it                       |
| The speaker freezes                       | Word-for-word script                                            | Replace with bookmarks and note cues                                  |
| Reviewers write "not what was advertised" | The outline drifted off the accepted abstract                   | Re-read the abstract before finalizing; realign or tell the organizer |
| It reads as a vendor pitch                | Product features are the pillars                                | Make the problem the pillars; the product is evidence, not structure  |
