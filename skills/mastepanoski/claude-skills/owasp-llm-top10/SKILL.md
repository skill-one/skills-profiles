# OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications Security Audit

This skill enables AI agents to perform a comprehensive **security assessment** of Large Language Model (LLM) and Generative AI applications using the **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025**, published by the OWASP GenAI Security Project.

The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications identifies the most critical security risks in systems that integrate large language models, covering vulnerabilities from prompt injection to unbounded resource consumption. This is the authoritative industry standard for LLM application security.

Use this skill to identify security vulnerabilities, assess risk exposure, prioritize remediation, and establish secure development practices for AI-powered applications.

Combine with "NIST AI RMF" for comprehensive risk management or "ISO 42001 AI Governance" for governance compliance.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Auditing security of LLM-powered applications before deployment
- Reviewing GenAI integrations for security vulnerabilities
- Assessing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- Evaluating chatbot or AI assistant security
- Conducting penetration testing of AI features
- Building secure AI application architectures
- Reviewing third-party AI API integrations
- Preparing for security compliance reviews
- Responding to AI-related security incidents

## Inputs Required

When executing this audit, gather:

- **application_description**: Description of the AI application (purpose, LLM used, architecture, features, user base) [REQUIRED]
- **architecture_details**: System architecture (APIs, databases, vector stores, plugins, integrations) [OPTIONAL but recommended]
- **llm_provider**: LLM provider and model (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, self-hosted, etc.) [OPTIONAL]
- **deployment_context**: Deployment environment (cloud, on-premise, hybrid, edge) [OPTIONAL]
- **data_sensitivity**: Types of data processed (PII, financial, health, proprietary) [OPTIONAL]
- **existing_controls**: Current security measures (auth, rate limiting, content filtering) [OPTIONAL]
- **specific_concerns**: Known vulnerabilities or areas of focus [OPTIONAL]
- **testing_authorization**: Explicit authorization, environment, and boundaries for active testing [REQUIRED for live or active tests]
- **safe_testing_mode**: documentation-only, staging, production-readonly, or production-approved [OPTIONAL, defaults to documentation-only unless authorization is clear]

## Authorized Testing Boundary

Only run active security tests on systems the user owns or is explicitly authorized to test. If authorization is absent or unclear, perform a documentation and architecture review only, using safe hypothetical examples instead of live payload execution.

For production systems:
- Prefer staging or read-only validation
- Avoid denial-of-service, destructive, persistence, or real exfiltration tests unless written scope explicitly permits them
- Redact credentials, secrets, PII, and sensitive prompt or model outputs in reports
- Stop and report if testing crosses the approved scope
