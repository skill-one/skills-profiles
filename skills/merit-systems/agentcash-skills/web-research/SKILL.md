  Neural web search and content extraction using x402-protected APIs. Better than WebSearch for deep research and WebFetch for blocked sites.

  USE FOR:
  - Deep web research and investigation
  - Finding similar pages to a reference URL
  - Extracting clean text from web pages
  - Scraping sites that block standard fetchers
  - Getting direct answers to factual questions
  - Research requiring multiple sources
  - Crawling multiple pages from a website

  TRIGGERS:
  - "research", "investigate", "deep dive", "find sources"
  - "similar to", "pages like", "more like this"
  - "scrape", "extract content from", "get the text from"
  - "blocked site", "can't access", "paywall"
  - "what is", "explain", "answer this"
  - "crawl", "crawl site", "scrape entire site"

  Use agentcash.fetch for stableenrich.dev endpoints. Prefer Exa for semantic/neural search, Firecrawl for direct scraping.

See [rules/when-to-use.md](rules/when-to-use.md) for detailed guidance.

## Exa Neural Search

Semantic search that understands meaning, not just keywords:

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/exa/search",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "query": "startups building AI agents for customer support",
    "numResults": 10
  }
)
```

**Options:**
- `query` - Search query (required)
- `numResults` - Number of results (default: 5, max: 100)
- `type` - Search mode/latency strategy ("auto", "fast", "deep"). Do not put content verticals here — use `category`
- `includeDomains` - Only search these domains (full hostnames; some domains like reddit.com, x.com, nytimes.com are blocked and return 400)
- `excludeDomains` - Skip these domains (same blocked-domain restriction applies)
- `startPublishedDate` / `endPublishedDate` - Date range filter
- `category` - Filter by content type: "company", "people", "research paper", "news", "pdf", "personal site", "financial report" (other strings are used as category hints)
- Tip: Use `category: "people"` for people/profile discovery

**Returns**: List of URLs with titles, snippets, and relevance scores.

## Find Similar Pages

Find pages semantically similar to a reference URL:

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/exa/find-similar",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "url": "https://example.com/article-i-like",
    "numResults": 10
  }
)
```

Great for:
- Finding competitor products
- Discovering related content
- Expanding research sources

## Extract Text Content

Get clean, structured text from URLs:

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/exa/contents",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "urls": [
      "https://example.com/article1",
      "https://example.com/article2"
    ]
  }
)
```

**Options:**
- `urls` - Array of URLs to extract
- `text` - Include full text (default: true)
- `highlights` - Include key highlights

Cheapest option ($0.002) when you already have URLs and just need the content.

## Direct Answers

Get factual answers to questions:

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/exa/answer",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "query": "What is the population of Tokyo?"
  }
)
```

Returns a direct answer with source citations. Best for:
- Factual questions
- Quick lookups
- Verification of claims

## Firecrawl Scrape

Scrape a single page to clean markdown:

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/firecrawl/scrape",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "url": "https://example.com/page-to-scrape"
  }
)
```

**Options:**
- `url` - Page to scrape (required, the only parameter)

**Returns**: `url` (final URL after redirects), `title`, and `content` (page as markdown).

**Advantages over WebFetch:**
- Handles JavaScript-rendered content
- Bypasses common blocking
- Extracts main content only
- LLM-optimized markdown output

## Firecrawl Search

Web search with automatic scraping of results:

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/firecrawl/search",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "query": "best practices for react server components",
    "limit": 5
  }
)
```

**Options:**
- `query` - Search query (required)
- `limit` - Number of results (default: 5, max: 10)

Returns results with title, URL, description, and a content snippet (first ~500 chars of markdown) for each.

## Cloudflare Website Crawl

Crawl multiple pages from a website with browser rendering. Async two-step pattern.

**Step 1: Start the crawl (paid, $0.10)**

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/cloudflare/crawl",
  method="POST",
  body={
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "limit": 10,
    "depth": 1,
    "formats": ["markdown"]
  }
)
```

Returns 202 with `{"token": "jwt..."}`.

**Step 2: Poll for results (SIWX, free)**

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/cloudflare/jobs?token=JWT_TOKEN",
  method="GET"
)
```

Poll every 3-5 seconds until complete.

**Parameters:**
- `url` (required) — starting URL
- `limit` (default 10, max 25) — max pages
- `depth` (default 1, max 3) — max link depth
- `formats` — `["markdown", "html", "json"]`
- `render` (default false) — execute JavaScript
- `source` — URL discovery source: "all", "sitemaps", or "links"
- `options.includePatterns` / `excludePatterns` — URL wildcards (exclude wins); `options.includeExternalLinks` / `includeSubdomains` — scope flags

Good for: crawling docs sites, scraping multiple pages, building sitemaps.

## Workflows

### Deep Research

- [ ] (Optional) Check balance: `agentcash.get_balance`
- [ ] Search broadly with Exa
- [ ] Find related sources with find-similar
- [ ] Extract content from top sources
- [ ] Synthesize findings

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/exa/search",
  method="POST",
  body={"query": "AI agents in healthcare 2024", "numResults": 15}
)
```

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/exa/find-similar",
  method="POST",
  body={"url": "https://best-article-found.com"}
)
```

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/exa/contents",
  method="POST",
  body={"urls": ["url1", "url2", "url3"]}
)
```

### Blocked Site Scraping

- [ ] Try WebFetch first (free)
- [ ] If blocked/empty, use Firecrawl (full JS rendering) for JS-heavy sites

```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/firecrawl/scrape",
  method="POST",
  body={"url": "https://blocked-site.com/article"}
)
```

## Cost Optimization

- **Use Exa contents** ($0.002) when you already have URLs
- **Use WebSearch/WebFetch first** (free) and fall back to x402 endpoints
- **Batch URL extraction** - pass multiple URLs to Exa contents
- **Limit results** - request only as many as needed

## Parallel Calls

Independent searches can run in parallel:

```mcp
# These don't depend on each other
agentcash.fetch(url=".../exa/search", body={"query": "topic A"})
agentcash.fetch(url=".../exa/search", body={"query": "topic B"})
```
