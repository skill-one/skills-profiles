# Qwen Image 3

Use `POST https://api.acedata.cloud/qwen-image/images` for generation and editing.

## Models

| Model | Best for |
|---|---|
| `qwen-image-3.0` | Value, throughput, batch production |
| `qwen-image-3.0-pro` | Complex layouts, small text, fine detail |

## Generate

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.acedata.cloud/qwen-image/images \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACEDATACLOUD_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"qwen-image-3.0","prompt":"A clean bilingual product poster","size":"1024*1024","n":1}'
```

## Edit with references

```json
{
  "model": "qwen-image-3.0-pro",
  "prompt": "Keep the subject and change the scene to a cinematic city at night",
  "image_urls": ["https://cdn.acedata.cloud/r9vsv9.png"],
  "size": "2048*2048",
  "n": 1,
  "prompt_extend": true,
  "enable_thinking": true,
  "watermark": false
}
```

Use 1–3 reference images. `prompt_extend_mode=agent` is text-to-image only. `n` supports 1–6. Output size uses `WIDTH*HEIGHT`, with pixel area between 512×512 and 2048×2048 and aspect ratio between 1:8 and 8:1.

## Async tasks

Set `async: true` or provide `callback_url`. Poll the returned task with:

```json
POST /qwen-image/tasks
{"action":"retrieve","id":"TASK_ID"}
```

Task retrieval is free. Keep polling every 15 seconds until the response is terminal.
