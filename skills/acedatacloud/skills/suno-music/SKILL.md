# Suno Music Generation

Generate AI-powered music through AceDataCloud's Suno API.

> **Setup:** See [authentication](../_shared/authentication.md) for token setup.

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.acedata.cloud/suno/audios \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACEDATACLOUD_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "a happy pop song about coding", "model": "chirp-v6", "callback_url": "https://api.acedata.cloud/health"}'
```

> **Async:** All generation is async. See [async task polling](../_shared/async-tasks.md). Poll via `POST /suno/tasks` with `{"id": "<task_id>"}` every 3-5 seconds.

## Available Models

| Model | Best For |
|-------|---------|
| `chirp-v6` | Current v6 model |
| `chirp-v6-wild` | v6 Wild model |
| `chirp-v6-mini` | v6 Mini model |
| `chirp-v5-5` | Previous model name, retained for compatibility |
| `chirp-v5` | High quality |
| `chirp-v4-5-plus` | Enhanced v4.5 |
| `chirp-v4-5` | Good balance of quality and speed |
| `chirp-v4` | Fast, reliable |
| `chirp-v3-5` | Legacy, stable |
| `chirp-v3-0` | Legacy |

## Core Workflows

### 1. Quick Generation (Inspiration Mode)

Generate a song from a text description. Suno creates lyrics, style, and music automatically.

```json
POST /suno/audios
{
  "prompt": "an upbeat electronic track about the future of AI",
  "model": "chirp-v6",
  "instrumental": false
}
```

### 2. Custom Generation (Full Control)

Provide your own lyrics, title, and style for precise control.

```json
POST /suno/audios
{
  "custom": true,
  "lyric": "[Verse]\nCode is poetry in motion\n[Chorus]\nWe build the future tonight",
  "title": "Digital Dreams",
  "style": "Synthwave, Electronic, Dreamy",
  "model": "chirp-v6",
  "vocal_gender": "f"
}
```

### 3. Extend a Song

Continue an existing song from a specific timestamp with new lyrics.

```json
POST /suno/audios
{
  "action": "extend",
  "audio_id": "existing-audio-id",
  "lyric": "[Bridge]\nNew section lyrics here",
  "continue_at": 120.0,
  "style": "Same style as original"
}
```

### 4. Cover / Remix

Create a new version of an existing song in a different style.

```json
POST /suno/audios
{
  "action": "cover",
  "audio_id": "existing-audio-id",
  "style": "Jazz, Acoustic, Mellow"
}
```

### 5. Full Song Creation Workflow

For best results follow this multi-step workflow:

1. **Generate lyrics** — `POST /suno/lyrics` with a topic/prompt
2. **Optimize style** — `POST /suno/style` to refine style description
3. **Generate music** — `POST /suno/audios` with custom action, lyrics + style
4. **Poll task** — `POST /suno/tasks` with `id` (or `ids` for batch) until status is complete
5. **Optional: Extend** — Use extend action to add more sections
6. **Optional: Concat** — Use concat action to merge extended segments
7. **Optional: Convert** — Get WAV (`/suno/wav`), MIDI (`/suno/midi`), or MP4 (`/suno/mp4`)

## Available Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `generate` | Generate from prompt (default) |
| `extend` | Continue an existing audio from a timestamp |
| `upload_extend` | Upload external audio, then extend it |
| `upload_cover` | Upload external audio, then create a cover |
| `concat` | Concatenate extended segments into one track |
| `cover` | Copy the style of an existing audio |
| `artist_consistency` | Generate in a custom singer's style |
| `artist_consistency_vox` | Artist consistency with vocal focus |
| `stems` | Separate a track into stems |
| `all_stems` | Separate into all available stems |
| `replace_section` | Replace a specific time range in a song |
| `underpainting` | Add accompaniment to an uploaded song |
| `overpainting` | Add vocals to an uploaded song |
| `remaster` | Remaster an existing audio |
| `mashup` | Blend multiple audio IDs together |
| `samples` | Add samples to an uploaded song |
| `inspo` | Generate a song inspired by an existing audio |

## Custom Music Models (Beta)

Custom models learn reusable musical characteristics from 6–24 authorized audio files. Creation is a paid, long-running operation. Ask the user to confirm the files and cost before submitting it.

### Create

```json
POST /suno/custom-models
{
  "action": "create",
  "name": "My Album Sound",
  "audio_urls": [
    "https://cdn.example.com/track-01.mp3",
    "https://cdn.example.com/track-02.mp3",
    "https://cdn.example.com/track-03.mp3",
    "https://cdn.example.com/track-04.mp3",
    "https://cdn.example.com/track-05.mp3",
    "https://cdn.example.com/track-06.mp3"
  ]
}
```

Send a stable `Idempotency-Key` header and reuse it after network failures. Save the returned `id`; query it until `status` is `ready`.

### Query and list

```json
POST /suno/custom-models
{"action": "retrieve", "id": "<custom-model-id>"}
```

```json
POST /suno/custom-models
{"action": "retrieve_batch", "status": "ready", "limit": 20, "offset": 0}
```

### Generate

```json
POST /suno/custom-models
{
  "action": "generate",
  "id": "<ready-custom-model-id>",
  "lyric": "[Verse]\nOriginal lyrics here",
  "style": "warm indie pop",
  "title": "New Song",
  "async": true
}
```

Async acceptance is not terminal success: poll the returned task and inspect `response.success`. A custom-model request never falls back to another model. The model must belong to the current Suno application and have `status: "ready"`.

### Archive

```json
POST /suno/custom-models
{"action": "delete", "id": "<custom-model-id>"}
```

`delete` archives the platform resource and prevents further use. `capacity_released: false` means it does not promise that model capacity was released.

| `audio_weight` | number | Weight for audio reference when covering (advanced, v5+ only) |
| `duration` | integer | Target track length in seconds (typically 10–360). Best supported on `generate` with `custom: true` on newer models such as `chirp-v5-5` |

```
[Verse 1]
Your verse lyrics here

[Chorus]
Catchy chorus lyrics

[Bridge]
Bridge section

[Outro]
Ending lyrics
```

## Gotchas

- All generation is **async** — always set `"callback_url"` to get a task id immediately, then poll `/suno/tasks` using `{"id":"<task_id>"}` or `{"ids":[...],"action":"retrieve_batch"}`
- **CRITICAL:** Check the `state` field — only `state: "complete"` with `success: true` means done. During `pending`, the API may return intermediate `audio_url` values (streaming previews). Do NOT stop polling just because `audio_url` is non-empty
- Lyrics max ~3000 characters. For longer songs, use the **extend** workflow
- Style tags are descriptive phrases, not enum values (e.g., "Synthwave, Electronic, Dreamy")
- `vocal_gender` ("f"/"m") is only supported on v4.5+ models
- `variation_category` ("high"/"normal"/"subtle") is only supported on v5+ models
- `duration` is forwarded as you send it — support varies by model and action, and an unsupported combination may ignore it or return an error, so verify with one request before batching. Note the request `duration` is a *target*; the `duration` in each returned clip is the *actual* length and will vary slightly
- The `concat` action merges extended song segments — requires audio_id of the extended track
- `persona` requires an existing `audio_id` and a `name`; optional `vox_audio_id`, `vocal_start`, `vocal_end`, and `description` refine the vocal reference
- Upload external audio via `/suno/upload` before using it with extend/cover
