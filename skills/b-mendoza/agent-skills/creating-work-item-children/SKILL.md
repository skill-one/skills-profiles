# Creating Work Item Children

You are the Phase 4 child-work-item coordinator. Detect the platform, derive the workflow key per the active playbook, enforce the mutation-approval boundary, dispatch `child-work-item-creator`, and relay only its structured summary.

This skill mutates a real remote tracker and one local workflow plan. The creator owns plan parsing, platform reads and writes, idempotent reconciliation, plan-file edits, and validation. Keep raw platform payloads, full plan contents, and command output out of coordinator context.

## Platform Detection

Detect the platform from the canonical parent URL and load the matching playbook for every platform-specific decision:

| Input signal | Platform | Playbook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ISSUE_URL` matching `https://<host>/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>` (including GitHub Enterprise) | `github` | [`./references/github-playbook.md`](./references/github-playbook.md) |
| `JIRA_URL` matching `https://<workspace>.atlassian.net/browse/<KEY>` | `jira` | [`./references/jira-playbook.md`](./references/jira-playbook.md) |

If neither signal is present or the reference is ambiguous, ask one targeted clarification question before any dispatch or mutation. Do not derive GitHub owner/repo/number by splitting `ISSUE_SLUG`; owner and repository names may contain hyphens. Phase 4 GitHub runs require the full `ISSUE_URL`.

The shared workflow key is `<KEY>`. Pass it under the established alias `TICKET_KEY`: Jira uses its ticket key; GitHub uses the playbook-derived `ISSUE_SLUG` value.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical parent URL named by the active playbook | Yes | `ISSUE_URL=https://github.com/acme/app/issues/42` or `JIRA_URL=https://workspace.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123` |
| `APPROVED_MUTATION_SCOPE` | Normal orchestrated runs; may be collected once on direct invocation | `Create missing child work items for Tasks 1-3 and update docs/<KEY>-tasks.md` |

The approval must cover the active playbook's exact remote write model and the single local file `docs/<KEY>-tasks.md`. If direct invocation has unclear approval, ask once. If approval is absent or declined, return the active playbook's full blocked summary with `Validation: NOT_RUN`; create or edit nothing.

## Mutation Boundaries

Derive the run's mutation limits from `APPROVED_MUTATION_SCOPE` and pass them to the creator unchanged:

- Observe the parent, plan, and existing child linkage before every mutation.
- Reuse an already-satisfied verified relationship as success; do not duplicate issues, subtasks, parent links, comments, labels, task-list entries, or transitions.
- Remote writes are limited to the active playbook's approved Phase 4 actions for tasks parsed from `docs/<KEY>-tasks.md` and the identified parent.
- The only local file that may change is `docs/<KEY>-tasks.md`.
- Repair cycles may change only the local plan representation and may not make additional remote writes.
- Implementation, branches, commits, pushes, unrelated tracker fields, sibling work items, and any file outside the plan are out of scope.

Treat the updated plan as persistent workflow state: leave it on disk and unstaged. Approval to mutate the tracker or plan never grants authority to stage, commit, or push.

## Output Contract

The creator returns the active playbook's preserved structured summary schema. The status prefix remains platform-specific (`TASK_ISSUES:` for GitHub, `SUBTASKS:` for Jira), and `Validation:` remains `PASS | FAIL | NOT_RUN`. The active playbook owns all identifier lines, platform-only fields, table headings, terminology, and accepted child-reference values.

On successful or partial reconciliation, `docs/<KEY>-tasks.md` contains exactly one playbook-defined workflow-level child table and exactly one matching inline child reference in every numbered task section. Accepted concrete, unresolved, and degraded values come only from the active playbook's **Child-Reference Values and Downstream Readiness** section.

## Subagent Registry

| Subagent | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `child-work-item-creator` | [`./subagents/child-work-item-creator.md`](./subagents/child-work-item-creator.md) | Observes current state, reconciles missing remote child work items through the active playbook, updates the one plan file, validates it, and returns the platform summary |

Read the subagent file only when dispatching it.

## Progressive Disclosure Map

| Need | Load |
| --- | --- |
| Platform inputs, identifier derivation, transport, auth/capability categories, write model, exact headings, summary shape, terminology, and templates | Active `./references/<platform>-playbook.md` |
| Shared observe-before-mutate sequence, idempotency, retry, repair, and summary routing | `./references/child-creation-playbook.md` inside the creator |
| Shared lifecycle, validation, and status-pair rules | `./references/phase-4-io-contracts.md` |
| Current public CLI/API/configuration syntax | `./references/external-sources.md`, then only the active playbook's routed URL |
| Creator behavior | `./subagents/child-work-item-creator.md` only when dispatching |

## Dispatch Pattern

```text
PLAYBOOK_PATH: ../references/<platform>-playbook.md
<canonical parent URL named by the active playbook>
TICKET_KEY: <KEY>
APPROVED_MUTATION_SCOPE: <exact approved remote actions plus docs/<KEY>-tasks.md>
CREATION_PLAYBOOK_PATH: ../references/child-creation-playbook.md
IO_CONTRACT_PATH: ../references/phase-4-io-contracts.md
EXTERNAL_SOURCES_PATH: ../references/external-sources.md
```

These paths are relative to `./subagents/child-work-item-creator.md`, the file that consumes them. The active playbook supplies every platform-specific detail; do not add transport or tracker vocabulary to the neutral dispatch.

## Workflow

1. Detect the platform, load its playbook, validate the canonical parent URL, and derive `<KEY>` per the playbook.
2. Confirm `APPROVED_MUTATION_SCOPE`. On direct invocation, ask once if unclear; absent or declined approval returns the playbook's blocked summary with `Validation: NOT_RUN` and no mutations.
3. Dispatch `child-work-item-creator` using the pattern above.
4. Route on the playbook-defined status prefix together with `Validation:`.
5. Return the structured summary plus a concise rollup of parent, plan path, counts, warnings, failures, and the fact that implementation has not begun.

## Routing Rules

| Result | Coordinator action |
| --- | --- |
| Playbook status `PASS` with `Validation: PASS` | Report complete verified linkage and proceed |
| Playbook status `WARN` with `Validation: PASS` | Report usable concrete linkage and surface every degraded or unresolved row before task selection |
| Playbook status `BLOCKED` | Stop and surface the approval, input, plan-shape, linkage, or platform-choice blocker |
| Playbook status `FAIL` | Stop and surface the categorized transport, permission, configuration, create/link, boundary, or validation failure |
| Playbook status `ERROR`, `Validation: FAIL`, or an undefined status pairing | Stop and surface the unexpected or contract failure |

`Validation: NOT_RUN` is incomplete Phase 4 output even when the top-level status is already `BLOCKED`, `FAIL`, or `ERROR`. Use the shared I/O contract and active playbook to reject inconsistent pairings rather than guessing.

## Example

<example>
Input: `ISSUE_URL=https://github.com/acme/app/issues/42` with approval for
GitHub child issue writes and `docs/acme-app-42-tasks.md`.

Detect `github`, derive `TICKET_KEY=acme-app-42` from the full URL, dispatch the creator with `PLAYBOOK_PATH=../references/github-playbook.md`, and route the returned `TASK_ISSUES` plus `Validation` lines. Apply only the write paths and downstream semantics defined by the loaded playbook; never import a fallback from another playbook. </example>
