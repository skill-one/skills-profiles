# Learn Disabled Example — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `learn-disabled-example-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install learn-disabled-example --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `learn-disabled-example-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails before this CLI has a public-library category, install Node or use the category-specific Go fallback after publish.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Golden fixture exercising the learn.disabled generation-time opt-out. With
the self-learning loop on by default for every fresh print, this fixture
pins the ONLY sanctioned way to print without it: `learn.disabled: true`.
The locked artifacts must carry no internal/learn tree, no
teach/recall/learnings commands, no learn store schema, and no
self-learning sections in README.md / SKILL.md / AGENTS.md. A regression
here means either the opt-out stopped working (learn surface appears) or
the default leaked into an opted-out spec.


## When Not to Use This CLI

Do not activate this CLI for requests that require creating, updating, deleting, publishing, commenting, upvoting, inviting, ordering, sending messages, booking, purchasing, or changing remote state. This printed CLI exposes read-only commands for inspection, export, sync, and analysis.

## Command Reference

**games** — Minimal syncable resource so the disabled shape still keeps its profile-derived store; the opt-out must remove the learn surface, not the ordinary data layer.

- `learn-disabled-example-pp-cli games` — List games


### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
learn-disabled-example-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query. `--json` (and other machine formats) keep that exit-2 contract and write `{"matches":[]}` on stdout so agents can inspect the envelope without treating a miss as success.

## Auth Setup

Run `learn-disabled-example-pp-cli auth setup` for the URL and steps to obtain a token (add `--launch` to open the URL). Then store it:

```bash
echo "$TOKEN" | learn-disabled-example-pp-cli auth set-token
```

Or set `LEARN_DISABLED_TOKEN` as an environment variable.

Run `learn-disabled-example-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color`.

Global format flags share one contract on promoted, novel, sync, and `--deliver` paths:

- `--json` — one JSON document on stdout (sync progress events go to stderr)
- `--compact` — keep identity/status/timestamp fields; does not change the document vs stream shape
- `--csv` / `--plain` — tabular rows (collection envelopes unwrap to the row array)
- `--quiet` — one identity value per row, no envelope

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  learn-disabled-example-pp-cli games --agent
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Read-only** — do not use this CLI for create, update, delete, publish, comment, upvote, invite, order, send, or other mutating requests

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set — piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Paths and state

Agents should treat the CLI's path resolver as part of the runtime contract:

- Use `--home <dir>` for one invocation, or set `LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_HOME=<dir>` to relocate all four path kinds under one root.
- Use per-kind env vars only when a specific kind must diverge: `LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_CONFIG_DIR`, `LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_DATA_DIR`, `LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_STATE_DIR`, `LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_CACHE_DIR`.
- Resolution order is per-kind env var, `--home`, `LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_HOME`, XDG (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`), then platform defaults.
- `config` contains settings like `config.toml` and profiles. `data` contains `credentials.toml`, `data.db`, cookies, and auth sidecars. `state` contains persisted queries, jobs, and `teach.log`. `cache` contains regenerable HTTP/cache files.
- Stored secrets live in `credentials.toml` under the data dir. Existing legacy `config.toml` secrets are read for compatibility and leave `config.toml` on the first auth write.
- Run `learn-disabled-example-pp-cli doctor --fail-on warn` to surface path and credential-location warnings. `agent-context` exposes a schema v4 `paths` block for agents that need the resolved dirs.
- For MCP, pass relocation through the MCP host config. The MCP binary does not inherit CLI flags:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "learn-disabled-example": {
        "command": "learn-disabled-example-pp-mcp",
        "env": {
          "LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_HOME": "/srv/learn-disabled-example"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Fleet precedence: an inherited per-kind env var overrides an explicit `--home` for that kind. Use `LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_HOME` or per-kind vars as durable fleet levers, and use `--home` only for a single invocation. Relocation is not reversible by unsetting env vars; move files manually before clearing `LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_HOME`, or `doctor` will not find credentials left under the former root.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
learn-disabled-example-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
learn-disabled-example-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
learn-disabled-example-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally as `feedback.jsonl` under the resolved data dir. They are never POSTed unless `LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `LEARN_DISABLED_EXAMPLE_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename). Binary-response commands write decoded payload bytes (not the base64 JSON envelope) and print a small JSON receipt on stdout; `--json`/`--csv` do not refuse when this sink is set. |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled or recurring agent reuses the same saved flags while providing different input each run.

```
learn-disabled-example-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
learn-disabled-example-pp-cli --profile briefing games
learn-disabled-example-pp-cli profile list --json
learn-disabled-example-pp-cli profile show briefing
learn-disabled-example-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `learn-disabled-example-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release, then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add learn-disabled-example-pp-mcp -- learn-disabled-example-pp-mcp
```

Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which learn-disabled-example-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   learn-disabled-example-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `learn-disabled-example-pp-cli <command> --help`.
