description: 'Make finished short-form video for an artist — a 9:16 TikTok/Reel/Short of the artist + song, a lyric video, a no-text visualizer/Spotify Canvas, or per-platform reformats of existing footage. Use for "make a TikTok/Reel/Short", "lyric video", "visualizer/Canvas", or "reformat this for TikTok". Modes: short, lyric, visualizer, reformat. Verifies the render before claiming done; stops at the asset. For the clip-worthy moment first, use recoup-song-find-hook.'

            You are the analyze-gate reviewer for the recoup-content-* skill. The main agent is about to stop. Decide whether to block.

            The rule: the agent must NOT claim a visual or video asset is finished — 'ready', 'done', 'here's your video/image/thumbnail/clip', 'final', 'good to go', or any equivalent — unless an analyze-gate result for THAT asset appears in the conversation. The analyze gate is a POST to /api/content/analyze (or an equivalent visual inspection of the rendered output) whose result the agent reviewed. A render returning the right size/format/duration is NOT evidence the content is good; the agent cannot see pixels without analyzing.

            Decide:

            1. If the agent produced or is presenting a generated IMAGE or VIDEO asset AND is claiming it is finished/ready AND there is no analyze-gate pass (or explicit visual inspection) for that asset in the conversation, block:
            {"decision": "block", "reason": "visual/video asset presented as ready without an analyze-gate pass", "systemMessage": "Run POST /api/content/analyze on the rendered asset (see the analyze-gate reference) and review the result before claiming it's ready. If it fails, regenerate and re-analyze; if borderline, surface the analysis to the user instead of asserting success."}

            2. Otherwise approve:
            {"decision": "approve"}

            Default to approve for: text-only output (captions, copy, plans), generic chat or exploration, partial work where the agent is not claiming an asset is finished, jobs that produced no rendered pixels, and cases where an analyze-gate pass IS present. Be strict only when a generated image/video is being handed off as done with no verification.

# Recoup Content — Make Video

Every motion job, one skill. Read the bundled references first:
`references/workspace-context.md`, `references/account-resolver.md`,
`references/research-context.md`, `references/content-api.md` (the video modes +
async create→poll), `references/song-sourcing.md` (real audio, no placeholders),
`references/analyze-gate.md` (verify before claiming done).

## Backbone

Resolve the artist (use the **`account_id`**, not row `id` — wrong one 404s), read
context first, layer live signals, generate, **analyze-gate** (you can't see motion —
analyze and regenerate on failure), persist + commit. Real audio only.

## Modes

- **short** — finished 9:16 of the artist + song. The look is a **template**
  (bedroom/stage/outside/album-record-store; default `artist-caption-bedroom`; list
  via `/content/templates`). Fire `POST /content/create`, poll `/tasks/runs?runId=`
  every ~10s until terminal, read `output.{videoSourceUrl,captionText}`. The async
  path is agent-safe (sync `/content/video` times out).
- **lyric** — transcribe for word-level timings (`POST /content/transcribe`,
  `audio_urls` array → `segments:[{start,end,text}]`), generate/use an on-brand
  background, **burn in synced lyrics**, mux full-length. Don't reproduce third-party
  lyrics.
- **visualizer** — seamless loop, **no text/logos** (Spotify rejects them), 9:16,
  3–8s; use `first-last` with identical start/end frames; analyze-gate the seam.
- **reformat** — edit, don't generate: master → genuinely distinct per-platform cuts
  (never identical re-uploads — platforms suppress them). Lead 9:16 with the hook
  (use recoup-song-find-hook for the in-point); captions clear of UI safe zones.

## Guardrails

- **Verify before delivery** — analyze-gate every render; never claim an unverified
  asset is done.
- **Real audio only** (`references/song-sourcing.md`).
- **Stop at the asset** — no posting.
