description: "INTERNAL — Recoup staff consulting workflow. Use for recoup-internal consulting requests. Fan one source insight into several scheduled, segment-routed email touches (trend-jack, proof, insight, build-in-public, 1:1 nudge) staged as drafts, never one-offs. Use after a call/extraction, on \"turn this into emails\", \"atomize for email\", \"what should I send the list\", or when a notable industry event lands. Powers the top-of-funnel email engine."

# Consulting Email Atomizer

**Workspace:** use the selected project and its `AGENTS.md`; keep existing entity folders and
Reality headings. Business paths below are relative to that project. Bundled resources are relative
to this installed skill; sibling capabilities resolve by their installed names. Never search another
private checkout for missing inputs. Use workspace identity, audience, pricing, and `DESIGN.md` fonts.
Local `_work` adapters and `evals` are optional workspace tools, not bundled dependencies. Check
presence and current help first; otherwise use an available connector for the same scoped operation.
If neither exists, report that step incomplete. For missing scorers, perform the stated checks and
label the result manual/unscored; never invent a numeric score or successful provider action.

Turn one source (a `signals/` entry, a fresh call, or an industry event) into several
email touches. Second consumer of the signal reservoir (LinkedIn is the first).
Full design: the selected workspace workflow specification (if available) · templates: `library/email-templates/` (06-11) ·
staging + frontmatter + routing: `email/AGENTS.md`.
**Voice + gate (always):** write in `recoup-internal-consulting-copy-writer` voice, then run every draft through the `recoup-internal-consulting-outbound-email` skill (read context, route to the right person, reader-POV check, names verified) before staging.

## Steps
1. **Take one source.** Prefer an existing `signals/` entry. If it is a raw call, run
   `recoup-internal-consulting-content-extraction` first so the signal exists. Record its path. It becomes `source:`.
   *No source, no email.*
2. **Atomize.** Decide which of the 6 formats this source can *honestly* yield (most yield 2-4, not
   all 6). A weak fit is a skip. Don't pad.
3. **Route.** For each chosen format, apply the default routing (`email/AGENTS.md`):
   trend-jack → cold/warm/targets · proof → everyone · insight → warm/targets/customers ·
   build-in-public → customers/warm · nudge → one named person · newsletter → actively subscribed newsletter recipients only. Coordinate the total send frequency rather than automatically sending every derivative.
4. **Resolve segments live.** Query Attio (`ATTIO_API_KEY`) for current membership of each target
   segment. Reconcile-on-touch, never a copied list. For a 1:1 nudge, pick the one named contact.
5. **Draft each touch.** Fill the matching `library/email-templates/` skeleton in the owner's voice.
   Always apply `recoup-internal-consulting-copy-writer` (the voice) and the `recoup-internal-consulting-outbound-email` gate (names
   verified against real context). Borrow `recoup-internal-consulting-content-drafter`'s AIDA and "you over I". Ground
   every claim in the source. No invented numbers, streams, or chart positions.
6. **Stage.** Write each to `email/outbox/<send_date>-<format>-<segment>.md` with the
   instance frontmatter (format · source · audience/recipient · send_date · `status: draft` · `channel: gmail`).
7. **Report the fan-out** (1 source into N drafts) with proposed send_dates spread across the week.
   **Never send.** Offer to stage Gmail drafts via `integrations/gmail/_work/create_draft.py` only on confirmation.

Output: N staged email drafts in `email/outbox/`, each tracing to one source.
Source: Ch. 3/5 (atomization plus the multi-format test) plus the selected workspace workflow specification (if available).

## Newsletter and distribution work
Read the selected workspace’s approved publishing system and current status through its AGENTS.md before drafting. Keep private strategy and customer proof in that workspace, not in this public skill.

Treat a newsletter as one publication with channel variants. Preserve its core value across email and native newsletter editions; adapt formatting and the next action for the audience. A blog is a durable reference, and a feed post is a standalone discovery piece. Neither automatically requires another email. Use one primary action without banning useful source links. Human-review discussion is conditional on the topic, not a required section.

Keep editorial broadcasts separate from welcome/sales sequences and customer adoption messages. CRM membership or a social subscription is not email consent. Resolve active subscriptions and suppressions before dispatch; never automatically enroll scraped contacts or reset an unsubscribe. Stop redundant acquisition pitches for current customers.

Record edition ID, audience, source evidence, approved claims, primary action/destination, per-channel review and release state, live URL or send ID, and follow-up owner. Verify destination and fulfillment before release. Track qualified responses and customer outcomes separately from audience growth. A draft, API acceptance and delivered message are different states. Existing authorization boundaries still apply.
