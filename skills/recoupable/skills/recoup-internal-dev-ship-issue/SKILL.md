description: INTERNAL — Recoup staff tooling. Never use for customer-facing or artist requests. Deliver a tracked GitHub issue end-to-end in the Recoup house style — documentation-driven (OpenAPI/contract first), then test-driven (red→green) implementation that matches the docs, verified against the live preview deployment, with results posted to the PR. Use when the user says "implement this issue", "build out issue #N", "ship the issue", "do the implementation", "take this issue and build it", or hands you a tracking issue (usually from the recoup-internal-dev-issue-tracker skill) to deliver. Covers docs-first ordering, the TDD loop, preview verification, the docs↔API↔reality reconciliation, and PR review hygiene. Pairs with the recoup-internal-dev-issue-tracker skill (which writes the issue this one implements).

# Implementing a Tracked Issue

How we take a tracking issue from open to shipped at Recoup. The bar: **the docs, the API, and the live preview all tell the same story — and every claim you make on the PR is something you actually ran.** No contract drift, no "should work," no untested assertions.

This is the delivery counterpart to the **recoup-internal-dev-issue-tracker** skill: that one writes the issue; this one implements it. The gold-standard reference slice this skill is built from is [chat#1789](https://github.com/recoupable/chat/issues/1789) (the tracking issue) → [docs#236](https://github.com/recoupable/docs/pull/236) (contract) → [api#653](https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/653) (implementation). Read those three together to see the whole loop.

## Prerequisite: implement against a real contract, not a vibe

Only start when the issue is a proper spec — it should carry a **Goal**, a **proposed contract** (endpoint, params, response shape), a **merge sequencing** block (docs → api), **Done-when** acceptance criteria, and **source references**. If it doesn't, stop and write/upgrade it with the **recoup-internal-dev-issue-tracker** skill first. Implementing against a vague issue is how you ship the wrong thing.

## The loop

```
1. Read the issue + the ground            (contract, Done-when, conventions, the sibling to mirror)
2. Docs first — the contract              (OpenAPI/reference PR; merge target: main)
3. API by TDD, matching the docs          (red→green→refactor; PR target: main; links the docs PR)
4. Wait for the preview deployment        (poll the PR-head commit until Ready)
5. Test the PR against the preview        (every Done-when criterion, against real data)
6. Reconcile docs ↔ API ↔ live results    (live response is ground truth; fix drift)
7. Comment on the PR as you test          (results table; triage bot findings)
8. Hand off in merge order                (docs → api; update the issue to Done on merge)
```

Run it in order. Docs-first and tests-first are not optional — they are the method.

**After every push that changes behavior — including review fixes, UI tweaks, and follow-up commits on an open PR — re-run steps 4→7 on that new commit before you say the work is done.** Unit tests alone are not enough. Do not hand back "fixed" or "addressed feedback" until the preview for *that* SHA is Ready, exercised live, and the results (with screenshots for **app and marketing** UI PRs) are posted on the PR. Skipping preview after a mid-PR change is the same failure mode as shipping untested code.

## 1. Read the issue + the ground

- **Extract from the issue:** the exact contract (path, params, response envelope, status codes), the merge order, every Done-when checkbox (these are your test plan), and the source references (verify any external API doc the issue cites is still accurate). If a cited doc is **client-side-rendered** (`WebFetch` returns an empty JS shell), read it with a **browser MCP** — e.g. Chrome DevTools `navigate_page` then `evaluate_script` to pull the rendered params/response — not `WebFetch`.
- **Read the ground:** each target submodule's `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` (branch rules, test/lint commands, response/validation/auth conventions).
- **Find the closest sibling and mirror it — don't invent.** Almost every endpoint has a neighbor that already solves 90% of the shape (auth, validation, response wrapping, error envelope, credits). Build by analogy to it; consistency with the immediate neighbor beats cleverness.

## 2. Docs first — the contract

Documentation-driven development: the docs/OpenAPI change is the contract, and it merges before the code that fulfills it.

- Branch from `main` in `docs`. Mirror the nearest sibling endpoint's OpenAPI block — params, **reuse existing schemas** (DRY), the shared error-response schema, the reference-page frontmatter, and the nav entry (adding the page to `docs.json` is what surfaces it in the generated `llms.txt`).
- **Additive edits to large/generated JSON.** Round-trip the file first (`json.dumps(json.load(f), indent=2)` vs the original); only load→add→dump if it reproduces byte-for-byte — otherwise (common) insert the new blocks via **anchored text edits** at brace boundaries so the diff stays purely additive. Either way, re-validate the result parses.
- **Accuracy over symmetry.** Document only what the API will actually return. Do not add a response code or field just because a sibling has it — an undocumented-but-real gap is better than a documented-but-false one.
- Commit, push, open the docs PR (base `main`). This is step 1 of the merge order.

## 3. API by TDD, matching the docs

Branch from `main`. Mirror the sibling implementation's layering (route → handler → validate → data function → response shaping; auth; credits).

**Red → green → refactor, one unit at a time:**

1. Write the failing test **first** in `__tests__/` (mock dependencies like the sibling tests do).
2. Run it and **confirm it fails** (RED) — usually "module not found" for a new file, or a real assertion failure for new behavior. Never write code and test in the same step.
3. Write the **minimum** implementation to pass (GREEN).
4. Refactor — **one exported function per file** (SRP). Extract inline helpers into their own lib files when a reviewer would (see how `gateChatStreamStart` / `waitForTerminalRunStatus` were pulled out).

Then: the implementation must match the **documented** contract exactly (params, response envelope, status codes). Run the **full domain test suite** (not just your files) to prove no regressions, then `tsc --noEmit` and lint. Commit, push, open the api PR (base `main`) — link the issue and the docs PR, and state the docs→api merge order in the body.

**Every time you open a PR (docs, api, or any sibling): update its row in the tracking issue's PR matrix in the same session** — replace the `repo#TBD` placeholder with the live ref and a `🔄 open — <verification status>` state. Don't wait until all PRs are open or until merge; an open PR with a `#TBD` row is tracker drift.

## 4. Wait for the preview deployment

This step is not one-and-done for the PR. **Every time you push a commit that changes runtime behavior or UI, start again here** for that commit's SHA — even if you already preview-tested an earlier SHA on the same branch.

- Find the preview for **your pushed commit** — `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/deployments?sha=<sha>` → its `/statuses` → `environment_url`, or the Vercel CLI (`vercel ls <project> --scope <team>` / `vercel inspect`).
- **Confirm it's built from your commit**, not a stale earlier preview — verify the deployment's sha. Testing a stale preview is a classic false-positive/false-negative trap.
- Poll until `Ready`. Background the poll on long builds; don't block.
- **Preview envs may run different auth than prod** (e.g. a separate Privy app; API-key hashes peppered with a different secret) — a prod-minted key/token can 401 on a preview even though the route is fine. Get a credential minted against the preview env before concluding anything.

## 5. Test the PR against the preview

Turn every **Done-when** criterion into a live check against the real preview URL (and re-check any criterion your latest push could have regressed — for UI/positioning changes, measure on mobile and desktop viewports):

- **Happy path** — the documented success response, with a real fixture (real id/ISRC/etc.).
- **Every status code** — including a **deliberately bad input** to confirm each 4xx (a non-UUID, an unknown id, a missing required param). This is how you confirm the documented error codes are real.
- **Auth** — 401 without a key; confirm no secret/env value is echoed in any response.
- **Cross-check the source of truth** — when it sharpens the assertion, query the DB / upstream directly (e.g. confirm a row's state, or that a per-item number is materially smaller than an aggregate). Capture **hard numbers**, not "looks right."
- **UI PRs (app and marketing)** — drive the changed surface in a real browser (agent-browser or equivalent). For layout claims (centered modal, mobile sheet, pricing cards/tables, etc.), capture screenshots and, when useful, element bounding boxes vs viewport — not "looks fine locally." Screenshots are required for both `app` and `marketing` preview verification; host them in the PR **comment** (not as commits on the feature branch).

## 6. Reconcile docs ↔ API ↔ reality

The **live response is ground truth.** Compare it field-by-field and code-by-code against the documented contract:

- If the live response carries fields or status codes the docs **missed**, add them to the docs. (In the reference slice, the live response carried a top-level `source_ids` and a `track_info.songstats_track_id` the spec lacked — the docs were patched to match.)
- If the docs claim something the API **doesn't do**, fix whichever is wrong — usually the docs, sometimes the code (e.g. the contract said "exactly one identifier" but the validator allowed several → tighten the validator).

All three must agree before you call it done. This step is the entire point of the loop — it's what prevents the doc-drift the stop endpoint had.

## 7. Comment on the PR as you test

- Post your verification as a **results table on the PR** — *documented* vs *actual* for each path, with the hard numbers and status codes you observed. For **app and marketing UI PR preview testing**, always include screenshots in the PR comment alongside the results (desktop + mobile when layout matters). Do this on the api PR; comment on the docs PR too when you reconciled it. After a follow-up push, post a **new** comment for the new SHA (or clearly update) — do not leave only the old SHA's results.
- **Reply on review threads** when you address them, citing the commit **and** the preview verification for that commit.
- **Triage bot review findings critically — validate before applying.** A bot's "P1" can be a false positive (a suggested revert that would reintroduce a bug; a "missing 501" the endpoint never emits). Confirm against the code/live behavior, then either fix it or reply with the reasoning for not. Don't rubber-stamp, don't blanket-dismiss.

## 8. Hand off in merge order

- Merge order is **docs → api** (the contract lands first). Honor hard dependencies (a database migration before the api that reads it).
- **Never merge without explicit user approval.** On approval, squash-merge to `main`.
- On merge, **update the tracking issue to Done** with the **recoup-internal-dev-issue-tracker** skill — a closure note (PR links, ✅ ISO date, merge path, what shipped, and a Verified clause citing the live results), and check off the Done-when boxes you actually verified.

## Quick reference

```bash
# Find + confirm the preview for the commit you pushed
gh api repos/recoupable/api/deployments?sha=<SHA> --jq '.[].id'
gh api repos/recoupable/api/deployments/<ID>/statuses --jq '[.[]|select(.state=="success")|.environment_url][0]'

# Run a single test RED→GREEN, then the whole domain + types + lint
pnpm exec vitest run lib/<domain>/__tests__/<unit>.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run lib/<domain> && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit && pnpm exec eslint <files>

# Test the preview, then post results on the PR
curl -s -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n" "<preview>/api/..." -H "x-api-key: <key>"
gh pr comment <n> --repo recoupable/api --body-file results.md
```
