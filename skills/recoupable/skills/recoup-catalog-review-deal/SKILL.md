description: 'Review and underwrite a music catalog deal end to end — ingest a messy royalty data room, value it (NPS/NLS, concentration, scenarios), build the executive dashboard, and write the IC memo. Use for "review/underwrite this catalog", "clean these royalty statements", "catalog valuation", "build the deal dashboard", or "write the IC memo". Modes: review (default), ingest, value, dashboard, report. Needs seller files; source/ is immutable and completion is gated.

# Recoup Catalog — Review Deal

Catalog deal review end to end. **review** runs the full diligence pipeline; ingest /
value / dashboard / report are the stages (each runnable alone). Work lives in a deal
workspace `deals/{deal-id}/` whose `source/` is **immutable evidence** (never write
into it). The workspace schema is `references/deal-workspace.md`; the scaffold is
`templates/deal-workspace/`. Deterministic math + validators ship in `scripts/`
(invoke relatively).

## Mode: review (the full diligence pipeline — gated)

1. **Scaffold** `deals/{deal-id}/`. Treat `source/` as immutable (a PreToolUse hook
   blocks writes to it on Claude Code).
2. **Ingest** → run **ingest** mode.
3. **Value** → run **value** mode.
4. **Dashboard** → run **dashboard** mode.
5. **Report** → run **report** mode if the user wants the IC memo / financing pack /
   seller report PDF.
6. **Completion gate (don't claim "ready" until all pass):**
   `python3 scripts/run-deal-checks.py deals/{deal-id}` exits clean;
   `build-deal-readiness.py` is not `blocked`; `assumptions.yaml` +
   `evidence-ledger.json` exist; findings closed/accepted/listed; every memo claim
   traces to evidence; `python3 scripts/validate-dashboard.py deals/{deal-id}` returns
   `status: ok`. Run these checks before claiming completion. Pausing for a
   background job, missing input, or an external system is allowed; state what
   remains pending without claiming the package is ready.

## Mode: ingest (clean the data room)

Normalize messy statements/rights/metadata into the canonical schema
(`references/canonical-schema.md`, `references/cleaning-rules.md`,
`references/normalization.md`; checklist `references/data-room-checklist.md`):
`auto-column-map.py`, `normalize-royalty-statement.py` (`extract-pdf-statement.py` for
PDFs), `dataroom-hygiene-scan.py`, `build-file-manifest.py` +
`build-manual-review-queue.py`, `calculate-concentration.py`. Validate with
`validate-normalized-ledger.py` + `validate-findings-evidence.py`. Never silently
coerce ambiguous rows — queue them for manual review.

## Mode: value (full valuation — needs ingested files)

Project value with `references/valuation-framework.md`:
`calculate-nps-nls-bridge.py`, `calculate-concentration.py`; apply decay, recoupment,
reserves; build downside/base/upside scenarios. Layer the deep-dives:
`royalty-audit.md`, `rights-review.md`, `pro-performance-income.md`,
`financing-underwrite.md`, `seller-prep.md`, `post-close-admin.md`, `red-flags.md`.
For public-data-only, use recoup-catalog-estimate-value.

## Mode: dashboard (the customer-facing DASHBOARD.html)

Author with creative freedom, then **gate it**:
`python3 scripts/validate-dashboard.py deals/{deal-id}` must return `status: ok`
(also run `run-deal-checks.py`). Do not present a dashboard that fails validation.

## Mode: report (IC memo / financing pack / seller report → PDF)

Assemble from the dashboard + workpapers using `references/output-templates.md`,
export one shareable PDF. **Every claim must trace** to `evidence-ledger.json` or
`assumptions.yaml`.

## Guardrails

- **`source/` is immutable evidence** — never write into it.
- **Completion is gated** — `run-deal-checks.py` clean, readiness not `blocked`,
  `validate-dashboard.py` ok before "ready".
- **Every claim traces to evidence** — no unsupported numbers.
- **Determinism where it counts** — royalty math runs in `scripts/`, not by hand.

## References & scripts

- `references/` — deal-workspace, deal-workflow, canonical-schema, cleaning-rules,
  normalization, data-room-checklist, valuation-framework, royalty-audit,
  rights-review, financing-underwrite, post-close-admin, pro-performance-income,
  red-flags, output-templates, methodology, recoup-api, seller-prep.
- `scripts/` — ingest/normalize, calculate-*, validate-*, run-deal-checks,
  build-deal-readiness. Ship alongside this skill; invoke relatively.
