# Serena Usage

Effective usage of the Serena MCP Server for project memory management, code intelligence, and maintaining continuity across AI agent sessions.

- Leverage native parallel subagent dispatch and 200k+ context windows where available.



## Activation Conditions

Use symptom -> action triggers: when one matches, apply this skill and verify with the protocol below.

**MUST activate when:**
- Serena is available for the project
- Task requires project memory continuity
- Task requires symbol navigation or Serena refactoring workflow
- Managing project memories for AI session continuity
- Navigating codebases using symbol-based tools
- Performing code refactoring with Serena's symbol management
- Setting up Serena onboarding for new projects
- Using Serena's memory system for project context preservation

**Critical: Always verify project activation FIRST with `get_current_config` before any Serena operations**

## Prerequisites

- Serena MCP Server configured and running
- Project activated (use `get_current_config` to verify, or `activate_project` if not activated)
- Onboarding completed for the target project (use `check_onboarding_performed` first)
- If not activated, run `activate_project` with project name or path
- If not onboarded, run `onboarding` tool after activation

---

## Onboarding Workflow

### First-Time Project Setup
1. **Check activation**: Call `get_current_config` to verify if project is activated
2. **Activate if needed**: If not activated, call `activate_project` with project name or path
3. **Check onboarding**: Call `check_onboarding_performed` to verify onboarding status
4. **Read manual**: If not onboarded, call `initial_instructions` to read the Serena Instructions Manual
5. **Initialize**: Call `onboarding` to complete project setup
6. Serena analyzes the project structure and creates initial context

### What Onboarding Captures
- Project language and framework detection
- Directory structure analysis
- Key file identification
- Symbol index creation
- Initial memory scaffolding

### Activation Check Pattern
```bash
# Always verify activation first
get_current_config
# If no active project, activate it
activate_project project="path/to/project"
# Then proceed with onboarding check
check_onboarding_performed
```

## Project Activation

### Why Activation Matters
Project activation is the first step when working with Serena. It tells Serena which project to work with and initializes the workspace context.

### Activation Workflow
1. **Check current status**: Call `get_current_config` to see if a project is already activated
2. **Activate if needed**: If no active project, call:
   ```
   activate_project project="project-name"
   # OR with path:
   activate_project project="path/to/project/directory"
   ```
3. **Verify activation**: Call `get_current_config` again to confirm activation succeeded
4. **Proceed with onboarding**: Once activated, check if onboarding is needed

### Activation Best Practices
- Always check `get_current_config` before attempting any Serena operations
- Use the workspace root path when activating
- Activation is session-specific — you may need to reactivate in new sessions
- After activation, the project context is available for all subsequent Serena operations

## Memory Management

### Core Concepts
Serena memories persist between sessions, providing continuity for AI agents across work sessions.

### Memory Operations

| Operation | Tool | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| List all | `list_memories` | See available memories |
| Read one | `read_memory` | Access specific memory content |
| Create | `write_memory` | Store new information |
| Update | `edit_memory` | Modify existing memory |
| Remove | `delete_memory` | Clean up obsolete information |

### Memory Structure

Serena memories use the Memory Bank naming convention for consistency and clarity. This structure organizes project intelligence into core files and tasks.

#### Core Files

| Memory Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `project-brief` | Foundation document defining core requirements and goals. Shapes all other memories. Created at project start. |
| `product-context` | Why this project exists, problems it solves, how it should work, and user experience goals |
| `active-context` | Current work focus, recent changes, and next steps with active decisions and considerations |
| `system-patterns` | System architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, and component relationships |
| `tech-context` | Technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, and dependencies |
| `progress` | What works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues |

#### Task Management Memories

Tasks are managed with dedicated memory files for tracking progress and history.

| Memory Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `task-{id}` | Individual task tracking (e.g., TASK001-implement-login.md) with original request, thought process, implementation plan, and progress logs |
| `task-index` | Master list of all tasks with IDs, names, statuses (Pending/In Progress/Completed/Abandoned), and last updated dates |

#### Task Memory Structure

Each task memory follows this format:

```markdown
# [Task ID] - [Task Name]

**Status:** [Pending/In Progress/Completed/Abandoned]
**Added:** [Date Added]
**Updated:** [Date Last Updated]

## Original Request
[The original task description as provided by the user]

## Thought Process
[Documentation of the discussion and reasoning that shaped the approach]

## Implementation Plan
- [Step 1]
- [Step 2]
- [Step 3]

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** [Not Started/In Progress/Blocked/Completed] - [Completion Percentage]

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1.1 | [Subtask description] | [Complete/In Progress/Not Started/Blocked] | [Date] | [Relevant notes] |

## Progress Log
### [Date]
- Updated subtask 1.1 status to Complete
- Started work on subtask 1.2
- Encountered issue with [specific problem]
- Made decision to [approach/solution]
```

#### Task Index Structure

The task-index memory maintains a structured record:

```markdown
# Tasks Index

## In Progress
- [TASK003] Implement user authentication -Working on OAuth integration
- [TASK005] Create dashboard UI -Building main components

## Pending
- [TASK006] Add export functionality -Planned for next sprint

## Completed
- [TASK001] Project setup -Completed on 2025-03-15
- [TASK002] Create database schema -Completed on 2025-03-17
```

#### Commands

When you request **add task** or **create task**, the agent will:
1. Create a new task memory with a unique Task ID
2. Document the thought process about the approach
3. Develop an implementation plan
4. Set an initial status
5. Update the task-index memory

To view tasks, the command **show tasks [filter]** will display filtered lists with valid filters:
- **all** - Show all tasks regardless of status
- **active** - Show only "In Progress" tasks
- **pending** - Show only "Pending" tasks
- **completed** - Show only "Completed" tasks
- **blocked** - Show only "Blocked" tasks
- **recent** - Show tasks updated in the last week

### When to Update Memories

**Update core memories when:**
- After completing significant features or functionality
- When making architectural decisions
- Discovering new project patterns or conventions
- Changing technical stack or dependencies
- Modifying data models or schemas
- At the start and end of each work session

**Update task memories when:**
- Creating new tasks via "create task" command
- Making progress on existing tasks
- Completing subtasks or entire tasks
- Encountering blockers or issues
- Changing task status (Pending → In Progress → Completed/Abandoned)

### Memory Creation Workflow

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS check for relevant existing memories before creating new ones**

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **List available memories**: Use `list_memories` to see all existing memories
2. **Analyze relevance**: Identify if any existing memory covers the same topic/concept
3. **Check memory content**: If relevant memories found, use `read_memory` to examine their content
4. **Match criteria**:
   - Same feature/technology/topic domain
   - Overlapping purpose or scope
   - Related architectural decisions
   - Similar problem space or concern
5. **Decision**:
   - **IF relevant memory exists**: Update the existing memory using `edit_memory` with new information and current timestamp
   - **IF no relevant memory exists**: Create new memory using `write_memory`

#### Matching Guidelines

A new memory entry is relevant to an existing memory if:

| Criteria | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Same feature area | "admin-features" already covers admin workflows → add new admin task details to it |
| Same technology | "auth-context" already covers authentication → add new auth implementation details to it |
| Related architecture | "system-patterns" covers architecture decisions → add new architectural choices to it |
| Same domain concern | "ui-components-and-styling" covers component library → add new component specs to it |
| Project-wide update | "project-overview" covers overall status → add general project updates to it |

#### Update Pattern for Existing Memories

When updating existing memories, follow this structure:

```markdown
## {Topic} — Updated [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

### [Date] - Update
- [New information or decision]
- [Implementation details or findings]
- [Related changes or impacts]
- [Next actions or considerations]

### Previous Context
[Preserve existing relevant information]
```

#### Examples of Memory Consolidation

**Scenario 1: Adding new admin feature specs**
```
Existing: admin-features.md (500 bytes)
New info: New user moderation workflow specs
Action: Update admin-features.md with new section, update timestamp
```

**Scenario 2: Fixing SQL bug**
```
Existing: csx3006-sql-fixes-2026-02-13.md
New info: Another SQL bug related to same issue
Action: Update csx3006-sql-fixes-2026-02-13.md, add new fix details, update timestamp
```

**Scenario 3: New authentication implementation detail**
```
Existing: auth-context.md
New info: Session management implementation specifics
Action: Update auth-context.md with new implementation section, update timestamp
```

**Scenario 4: New database-fix memory for different issue**
```
Existing: csx3006-sql-fixes-2026-02-13.md (column name fixes)
New info: Index optimization fixes (different topic)
Action: Create NEW memory: csx3006-index-fixes-2026-02-16.md
```

#### When to Create New Memories

Create a NEW memory only when:

- **Different domain**: Topic is fundamentally different from existing memories
- **Major milestone**: New phase or significant project shift
- **New technology stack**: Unrelated to existing technical context
- **Time-based tracking**: Fix memories, daily updates, or dated logs
- **Overwhelming size**: Existing memory would exceed 5-10 KB with additions

**Examples of when to create new memories:**
```
Existing: admin-features.md
New: Performance analysis reports → Create NEW: performance-analysis.md

Existing: ui-components-and-styling.md
New: Mobile responsiveness specifications → Create NEW: mobile-responsive.md

Existing: csx3006-sql-fixes-2026-02-13.md (database schema corrections)
New: API endpoint bug fixes → Create NEW: api-fixes-2026-02-16.md
```

### Memory Bank Documentation Guidelines

The Serena memories follow the Memory Bank structure for comprehensive project intelligence. Key guidelines:

**Task Progress Updates:**
- Always update both the subtask status table AND the progress log when making progress
- The subtask table provides quick visual reference of current status
- The progress log captures the narrative and details of the work process
- Each progress log entry should include date, accomplishments, challenges, and decisions
- Update task status in `task-index` to reflect current progress

**Documentation Flow:**
```
New Task → Create task-{id}.py memory → Update task-index
Progress → Update task-{id}.py log table → Update task-index
Discovery → Create/ update appropriate core memory
Architecture Decision → Update system-patterns memory
Completion → Update progress memory → Clear from active tasks
```

**Active-Context Format:**
```markdown
## Active Context — Updated [Date]

### Current Focus
- Implementing user authentication with NextAuth.js
- Building recipe CRUD API routes

### Recent Decisions
- Chose MongoDB Atlas over Cosmos DB for cost
- Using server components for recipe listing page

### Blockers
- Image upload size limit needs investigation

### Next Steps
1. Complete login/signup UI
2. Add recipe creation form
3. Set up image upload to Blob Storage
```

## Code Navigation

### Symbol-Based Navigation

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `find_symbol` | Locate specific classes, functions, variables by name path |
| `find_referencing_symbols` | Find all usages of a symbol across the codebase |
| `get_symbols_overview` | High-level summary of symbols in a file |

### Navigation Workflow
1. Use `get_symbols_overview` on a file to understand its structure
2. Use `find_symbol` to locate a specific definition
3. Use `find_referencing_symbols` to understand impact before changes

---

## Code Refactoring

### Safe Refactoring with Serena

| Tool | Operation |
|------|-----------|
| `rename_symbol` | Rename across all references |
| `replace_symbol_body` | Replace implementation of a function/method |
| `insert_after_symbol` | Add new code after a definition |
| `insert_before_symbol` | Add new code before a definition |

### Refactoring Workflow
1. **Understand**: Use `find_symbol` and `get_symbols_overview`
2. **Assess Impact**: Use `find_referencing_symbols` to see all usages
3. **Plan**: Think through the changes needed
4. **Execute**: Use rename/replace/insert tools
5. **Verify**: Re-check references to confirm correctness
6. **Document**: Update memories with the change rationale

---

## File Search

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `find_file` | Locate files matching a name pattern |
| `list_dir` | Browse directory contents |
| `search_for_pattern` | Search for text/regex patterns across codebase |

---

## Task Adherence

Serena provides reflection tools to maintain focus:

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|------------|
| `think_about_collected_information` | After gathering context — is it sufficient? |
| `think_about_task_adherence` | After many interactions — am I still on track? |
| `think_about_whether_you_are_done` | Before concluding — have I completed everything? |

---

## Session Workflow

### Starting a Session
1. **Verify activation**: `get_current_config` → check if project is activated
2. **Activate if needed**: If no active project, `activate_project` → activate the workspace
3. **Check onboarding**: `check_onboarding_performed` → verify onboarding status
4. Complete onboarding if needed using onboarding workflow
5. `list_memories` → review all 10 available project memories
6. `read_memory` → load relevant memories for current work phase:
   - **Always:** Read `project-overview` (current status, tech stack, next steps)
   - **Phase 4 (Backend):** Read `database-integration-implementation-plan-task` (TASK-057 to TASK-092)
   - **Feature work:** Read specific feature memory (admin-features, recipe-features, auth-context)
   - **SQL work:** Read `csx3006-sql-fixes-2026-02-13.md` (column conventions, FK patterns)
   - **Notion sync:** Read `notion-implementation-tracking.md` (update protocol)
7. Begin work with current phase context

### During a Session
- **SQL/database work:** Check if `{topic}-fixes-{date}.md` exists → update OR create new memory for bug fixes
- **Feature implementation:** Check if `{feature-name}.md` exists → update OR create new memory for feature specs
- **Phase completion:** Update `project-overview.md` with new status percentage and current timestamp
- **Notion updates:** Use `notion-update-page` after completing plan tasks (TASK-001 → TASK-138)
- **Code navigation:** Use symbol tools to explore React components and future PHP backend files
- **NEW information flow:**
  1. Use `list_memories` to review all existing memories
  2. Identify if any existing memory covers the topic
  3. If relevant memory exists: Use `edit_memory` with new information + updated timestamp
  4. If no relevant memory: Use `write_memory` to create new memory

---

## Best Practices

- **ALWAYS check activation before any Serena operations using `get_current_config`**
- **ALWAYS check for relevant existing memories with `list_memories` before creating new ones**
- **CRITICAL: Use `edit_memory` to update existing memories with new timestamp rather than creating duplicates**
- Activate project first if not already activated using `activate_project`
- Check onboarding after activation, before first use on a project
- Keep memories concise — prefer structured data over prose
- Update memories incrementally, not in bulk rewrites
- Use consistent naming for memories across projects (Memory Bank convention)
- Leverage `think_about_*` tools for self-reflection on complex tasks
- For task tracking: Always update both subtask table AND progress log in task memories
- Keep `task-index` synchronized with task memory status changes
- Delete obsolete memories to prevent confusion
- Use task IDs from `task-index` as reference when discussing work
- When adding information to existing memories, update timestamp to YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Project not activated | Run `get_current_config` to verify, then `activate_project` with project path |
| Onboarding not detected | After activation, run `onboarding` tool explicitly |
| Memory not found | Check exact name with `list_memories` |
| Symbol not found | Ensure file is indexed; try broader name |
| Stale memories | Use `edit_memory` to update with current state and timestamp |
| Conflicting memories | Delete outdated entry, merge into single memory with consolidated content |
| Duplicate memories | Avoid by ALWAYS checking `list_memories` before creating new ones; use `edit_memory` to update existing |
| Unsure which memory to update | Use `list_memories` → review purpose of each → read relevant memories → update the most appropriate one |

<!-- MCP:START -->

<!-- PORTABILITY:START -->
## Cross-Client Portability

This skill is written to stay usable across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex.

- GitHub Copilot: keep the folder in a Copilot-visible skill path or wrap the
  workflow in project instructions when folder discovery is unavailable.
- Claude Code: keep the folder in a local skills directory or a compatible plugin source.
- Codex: install or sync the folder into
  `$CODEX_HOME/skills/serena-usage` and restart Codex after major changes.

<!-- PORTABILITY:END -->

## MCP Availability And Fallback

Preferred MCP Server: Serena MCP

- Fallback prompt: "Use the Serena Usage skill without MCP. Follow the documented local or manual fallback, show the selected tool surface, and report the verification evidence."
- Use `rg`, `git diff`, targeted file reads, and local Markdown memory files when Serena is unavailable.
- Keep a lightweight Memory Bank in repo docs or notes so project continuity still survives across sessions.
- Do not claim an MCP operation was used when the active host does not expose it.

<!-- MCP:END -->

## Anti-Patterns

- Starting without a clear success condition: The skill becomes advice-shaped instead of workflow-shaped.
- Skipping the bundled references or scripts: You lose the proven path the catalog is trying to preserve.
- Claiming completion without concrete evidence: A future agent or reviewer cannot trust the result or resume the work safely.

## Verification Protocol

Before claiming "skill applied successfully":

1. Pass/fail: The Serena Usage workflow names the agent boundary, delegated scope, and expected return artifact.
2. Pass/fail: Context passed to helpers is minimal, task-local, and free of hidden expected answers.
3. Pass/fail: Results are integrated only after evidence, diffs, or citations are checked by the controller.
4. Pressure-test scenario: Run the workflow on two similar tasks that must not share assumptions or leaked context.
5. Success metric: Zero context leakage; every delegated output is independently reviewable.

### Project-Specific Guide (Recipe Sharing System)

**Current Memory Structure (10 active memories):**

| Memory | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `project-overview` | Project status, tech stack, next steps | Central reference, read first |
| `database-integration-implementation-plan-task` | 138-task plan v2.0 status | 38% complete (Phases 1-3 done) |
| `csx3006-sql-fixes-2026-02-13` | SQL script corrections | Keep for debugging |
| `notion-implementation-tracking` | Notion sync protocol | Update when completing tasks |
| `admin-features` | Admin workflow, moderation, user management | Feature specs only |
| `recipe-features` | Recipe CRUD, search, reviews, engagement | Feature specs only |
| `auth-context` | Session-based authentication flow | Phase 4 backend, Phase 5 integration |
| `routing-layouts` | Route configuration and page layouts | HashRouter with layout guards |
| `storage-data-model` | Pre-Phase 5 localStorage structure | Will be replaced by API |
| `ui-components-and-styling` | Component library and Tailwind v4 | Reusable components |

**Session-Start Pattern (Phase 4 — Backend Pending):**
1. `get_current_config` → verify project is activated
2. If not activated, `activate_project` with current workspace path
3. `check_onboarding_performed` → verify onboarding status
4. Complete onboarding if needed using standard workflow
5. `list_memories` → verify 10 memories available
6. Read `project-overview` → current status (38% complete, Phases 1-3 done)
7. Read `database-integration-implementation-plan-task` → Phase 4 tasks (TASK-057 to TASK-092)
8. Begin PHP backend development: `backend/config/database.php`, `backend/helpers/`, then `backend/api/`

**Project-Specific Best Practices:**

**Database Conventions:**
- Database: `cookhub` (utf8mb4_unicode_ci)
- Tables: singular (user, recipe, ingredient, etc.)
- Columns: snake_case, `id` PKs
- PK access: `WHERE id = ?` on parent tables, FK references on child tables
- FKs: `{table}_id` columns

**Architecture:**
- Plain PHP (no frameworks, no Composer)
- Structure: `backend/{config, helpers, api}/`
- Each API file handles routing via `$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']`
- Auth: Session-based (HttpOnly cookies, `session` table)
- HTTP: Native `fetch()` with `credentials: 'include'`

**Documentation Flow:**
- SQL fixes → Check if `{topic}-fixes-{date}.md` exists → update OR create new memory
- Major milestones → update `project-overview.md` with new timestamp
- Phase completion → update `database-integration-implementation-plan-task.md` with progress
- Notion sync → update `notion-implementation-tracking.md` with sync status
- **ALL updates** → Include current timestamp in format: "Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"

**Naming Patterns Used:**
- Feature memories: lowercase kebab-case (admin-features, recipe-features, auth-context)
- Fix memories: `{name}-fixes-{date}.md`
- Status memories: `{project}-updates.md` or `{plan}-task.md`

## Memory Management Strategy for This Project

**Why 10 memories (not 15 from Memory Bank standard):**
- Project tracks implementation plan via `plan/upgrade-database-integration-1.md` (138 tasks) instead of task memories
- No individual `task-{id}` memories needed (tasks are in plan file)
- No `task-index` or `progress` memories (status in `project-overview.md`)
- Feature specs kept concise (admin-features, recipe-features, auth-context at ~500 bytes each)
- One-line reference memories for quick lookups (routing-layouts, storage-data-model, ui-components-and-styling)

**When to create new memories:**
- SQL/script fixes: `{topic}-fixes-{date}.md` (e.g., csx3006-sql-fixes-2026-02-13.md)
- Feature documentation: `{feature-name}.md` (e.g., admin-features.md)
- Major milestones: Update `project-overview.md` (status changes, architecture decisions)

**When NOT to create memories:**
- Individual tasks (use `upgrade-database-integration-1.md` task list)
- Everyday progress (project status tracked in `project-overview.md`)
- Code samples (code is in actual files, not memories)
- Historical one-time events (delete when obsolete)
- **INFORMATION THAT SHOULD UPDATE AN EXISTING MEMORY instead of creating a new one**

## Memory Update vs Creation Quick Reference

### Decision Tree

```
Need to store information?
│
├─ Check: `list_memories`
│  │
│  ├─ Existing memory covers this topic?
│  │  │
│  │  ├─ YES → Use `edit_memory` with new info + updated timestamp
│  │  │
│  │  └─ NO → Use `write_memory` to create new memory
│  │
│  └─ Proceed with work
```

### Common Match Patterns

| When adding info about... | Check memory... | If exists... | If not... |
|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Admin features/moderation | `admin-features` | Update it | Create `admin-features` |
| Recipe CRUD/search | `recipe-features` | Update it | Create `recipe-features` |
| Authentication/session | `auth-context` | Update it | Create `auth-context` |
| SQL fixes today | `{topic}-fixes-{date}` | Update it | Create new with today's date |
| Architecture decisions | `system-patterns` | Update it | Create `system-patterns` |
| Overall project status | `project-overview` | ALWAYS update it | Create `project-overview` |
| Component specs | `ui-components-and-styling` | Update it | Create if different topic |

### Edit Memory Pattern

```bash
# Always use this format when updating existing memories
edit_memory(
  memory_file_name="existing-memory-name",
  needle="section or content to replace or append after",
  repl="new information with timestamp:\n\n## [Section] — Updated YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\n\n- [new info]",
  mode="literal" # or "regex" as appropriate
)
```
