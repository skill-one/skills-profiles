# MCP Builder

Design MCP servers that are easy for agents to discover, compose, and trust.

- Leverage native parallel subagent dispatch and 200k+ context windows where available.


## When to Use

Use symptom -> action triggers: when one matches, apply this skill and verify with the protocol below.

- You are creating a new MCP server around an external API or internal platform.
- An existing MCP server needs better tool naming, schemas, pagination, or error handling.
- You need a workflow for evaluating whether an MCP server is actually useful for real agent tasks.
- You are deciding between TypeScript and Python MCP implementations.

## Glossary

- MCP Inspector: An interactive client for browsing registered tools, schemas, inputs, and outputs while you validate a server.
- Structured outputs: Predictable JSON or schema-backed payloads that downstream agents can parse safely instead of scraping prose.
- Workflow tool: A higher-level tool that coordinates several lower-level API steps into one agent-friendly operation.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Research First

Before implementation:

1. Read the current MCP protocol documentation.
2. Read the relevant SDK guide for your implementation language.
3. Review the target service API and list the highest-value operations.
4. Decide which operations should stay low-level and which deserve dedicated workflow tools.

### 2. Design Agent-Friendly Tools

Prefer tools that are easy to discover and compose:

- use clear action-oriented names
- keep schemas explicit and constrained
- support pagination and filters where lists can grow
- return structured content whenever the client can benefit from it
- write error messages that tell the agent what to do next

### 3. Implement Shared Infrastructure

Build common pieces before individual tools:

- authenticated API client
- error formatter
- response normalizer
- pagination helpers
- reusable schema utilities

### 4. Test the Server Like an Agent Would

Verify more than syntax:

- build or type-check the server
- inspect tool registration and descriptions
- run the server through MCP Inspector or an equivalent client
- confirm that common read and write flows behave predictably

### 5. Create Real Evaluations

A strong MCP server needs realistic read-only evaluations:

- write questions that require multiple tool calls
- keep answers stable and verifiable
- prefer realistic operator tasks over toy examples
- store the evaluation set with the server so regressions are visible later

## Shared Infrastructure Before and After

### Pagination Helper
```typescript
// Before
async function listTickets(page = 1) {
  return api.get(`/tickets?page=${page}`)
}

// After
export async function paginate<T>(fetchPage: (cursor?: string) => Promise<{ items: T[]; nextCursor?: string }>) {
  const items: T[] = [];
  let cursor: string | undefined;
  do {
    const page = await fetchPage(cursor);
    items.push(...page.items);
    cursor = page.nextCursor;
  } while (cursor);
  return items;
}
```

### Error Formatter
```typescript
// Before
throw new Error(`Request failed: ${response.status}`)

// After
throw formatToolError({
  code: 'tickets.list_failed',
  message: 'Unable to list tickets for the requested project.',
  status: response.status,
  nextAction: 'Check the project id and retry with a smaller page size.',
})
```

### Schema Utilities
```typescript
// Before
server.tool('create_ticket', { title: z.string(), priority: z.string() }, handler)

// After
const prioritySchema = z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']);
const ticketInput = buildToolSchema({
  title: z.string().min(1),
  priority: prioritySchema.default('medium'),
});
server.tool('create_ticket', ticketInput, handler)
```

## Language Guidance

### TypeScript

Prefer TypeScript when you want the strongest SDK ergonomics and schema-heavy tool definitions.

Primary references:

- [TypeScript MCP Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md)
- [MCP Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md)

### Python

Prefer Python when the target ecosystem or existing service code is already Python-heavy.

Primary references:

- [Python MCP Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md)
- [MCP Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md)

## Security, Observability, Auth Handling, Logging, and Versioning

### Security

Minimize scopes, redact secrets from errors, and keep authorization checks inside shared request middleware instead of duplicating them per tool.

### Observability

Log request identifiers, tool names, latency, and retry counts so agent failures can be traced without replaying everything manually.

### Auth Handling

Support token refresh or credential reload paths explicitly so agents get actionable failures instead of opaque 401 loops.

### Logging

Prefer structured logs with stable fields such as `tool`, `resource`, `status`, and `duration_ms` over free-form strings.

### Versioning

Treat tool names, schemas, and error contracts as public interfaces; add versions or deprecation notes before changing them in place.

<!-- PORTABILITY:START -->
## Cross-Client Portability

This skill is written to stay usable across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex.

- GitHub Copilot: keep the folder in a Copilot-visible skill path or wrap the
  workflow in project instructions when folder discovery is unavailable.
- Claude Code: keep the folder in a local skills directory or a compatible plugin source.
- Codex: install or sync the folder into
  `$CODEX_HOME/skills/mcp-builder` and restart Codex after major changes.

## MCP Availability And Fallback

Preferred MCP Server: None required

- Fallback prompt: "Use the MCP Builder skill without MCP. Rely on its local instructions, bundled resources, standard shell or editor tools, and direct verification. Show the evidence used before concluding."
- Do not claim an MCP operation was used when the active host does not expose it.
- Treat local files, tests, rendered outputs, logs, or screenshots as the fallback evidence path.

<!-- MCP:END -->

## Anti-Patterns

- Starting work before the plan or gate is clear: Execution drifts when success criteria are implied instead of explicit.
- Treating verification as optional cleanup: The last mile is where regressions and missing updates are usually hiding.
- Mixing planning, implementation, and release work in one jump: You lose the causal chain that explains why a change is safe.

## Verification Protocol

Before claiming "skill applied successfully":

1. Pass/fail: The Mcp Builder workflow names the agent boundary, delegated scope, and expected return artifact.
2. Pass/fail: Context passed to helpers is minimal, task-local, and free of hidden expected answers.
3. Pass/fail: Results are integrated only after evidence, diffs, or citations are checked by the controller.
4. Pressure-test scenario: Run the workflow on two similar tasks that must not share assumptions or leaked context.
5. Success metric: Zero context leakage; every delegated output is independently reviewable.

## Practical Rules

- Comprehensive API coverage is usually safer than a handful of overly clever workflow tools.
- Add workflow tools only when they remove real friction for agents.
- Keep tool descriptions concise enough to stay readable in tool lists.
- Structured outputs beat prose when downstream automation matters.
- Evaluation quality is part of the server quality, not a separate optional step.
