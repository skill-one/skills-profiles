# Notion Documentation

> Tech Stack Target / Version: Notion API current version, Markdown-to-Notion transforms, and local template scripts.

Use this skill when Notion is the system of record for specs, runbooks, project tracking, or knowledge management.

- Leverage native parallel subagent dispatch and 200k+ context windows where available.


## Current MCP Reality

As of March 2026, Notion documents two supported ways to use its MCP server:

- Hosted remote MCP endpoint: `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`
- Local stdio server package: `@notionhq/notion-mcp-server`

Hosted mode uses OAuth. Local mode uses an internal integration token. Official docs also list supported tools for searching content, reading pages, comments, users, and working with pages and databases.

## Activation Conditions

Use symptom -> action triggers: when one matches, apply this skill and verify with the protocol below.

- Creating or updating Notion pages
- Building project trackers or engineering knowledge bases
- Organizing specs, ADRs, and onboarding docs in Notion
- Adding review comments or using database-backed workflows

## Practical Workflow

1. Confirm whether the client exposes the hosted Notion MCP server or a local stdio connection.
2. Read or search existing pages before creating duplicates.
3. Use databases for tracked work and pages for long-form documents.
4. Keep properties simple: owner, status, last reviewed, tags.
5. If MCP is unavailable in the current client, fall back to local content prep using the included script and templates.

## Operational Notes

- Official Notion guidance currently documents an average rate limit of 20 requests per second for integrations.
- Tool names can vary slightly by MCP host, but the supported capabilities are stable: search, fetch page content, create or update pages, create or update databases, manage comments, and read user context.

## Documentation Stack Reference

Inherit the shared stack from [documentation-patterns](../documentation-patterns/SKILL.md#shared-documentation-stack): source-of-truth discovery, audience framing, structure selection, verification, and freshness checks. Keep this skill focused on Notion conversion and workspace behavior instead of restating the full stack.

## Cross-Client Portability

This skill is written to stay usable across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex.

- GitHub Copilot: keep the folder in a Copilot-visible skill path or wrap the
  workflow in project instructions when folder discovery is unavailable.
- Claude Code: keep the folder in a local skills directory or a compatible plugin source.
- Codex: install or sync the folder into
  `$CODEX_HOME/skills/notion-docs` and restart Codex after major changes.

## MCP Availability And Fallback

Preferred MCP Server: Notion MCP

- Fallback prompt: "Use the Notion Documentation skill without MCP. Follow the documented local or manual fallback, show the selected tool surface, and report the verification evidence."
- Draft content locally in Markdown or JSON, then use `scripts/notion-templates.js` and the Notion web UI for final publishing.
- Prefer page and database templates from this skill to avoid duplicate structures when working without MCP.
- Do not claim an MCP operation was used when the active host does not expose it.

## Anti-Patterns

- Writing for the author instead of the reader: It bakes in unstated context and leaves the actual audience unsure what to do next.
- Skipping concrete examples or commands: Abstract guidance is easy to approve and hard to apply correctly.
- Letting links, screenshots, or versions drift: Polished formatting does not help if the instructions are no longer true.

## Verification Protocol

Before claiming "skill applied successfully":

1. Pass/fail: The Notion Docs output identifies audience, purpose, source of truth, and freshness requirements.
2. Pass/fail: Shared documentation-stack guidance is referenced instead of duplicating another documentation skill.
3. Pass/fail: Claims, links, commands, examples, and screenshots are verified or explicitly marked unverified.
4. Pressure-test scenario: Apply the skill to a doc request with a stale command, missing owner, and conflicting audience.
5. Success metric: Zero undocumented assumptions; every reader-facing claim is sourced or scoped.
