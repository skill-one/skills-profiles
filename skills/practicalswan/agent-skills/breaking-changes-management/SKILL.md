# Breaking Changes Management

Use this skill when behavior, interfaces, configuration, or compatibility contracts change in a way that can break consumers.

- Leverage native parallel subagent dispatch and 200k+ context windows where available.


## Activation Conditions

Use symptom -> action triggers: when one matches, apply this skill and verify with the protocol below.

- Releasing a major version
- Renaming or removing public APIs
- Changing request or response shapes
- Replacing config keys, env vars, CLI flags, or file formats
- Writing migration notes, deprecation notices, or upgrade checklists

## Workflow

1. Identify the exact consumer-visible break.
2. State who is affected and from which version.
3. Provide the replacement path or mitigation.
4. Add before/after examples.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and any setup or usage docs that changed.

## Required Outputs

- Changelog entry with a clear `BREAKING` label
- Migration guide with old usage, new usage, and upgrade steps
- Deprecation timeline if removal is delayed
- Validation notes for any examples or scripts that changed

## Cross-Client Portability

This skill is written to stay usable across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex.

- GitHub Copilot: keep the folder in a Copilot-visible skill path or wrap the
  workflow in project instructions when folder discovery is unavailable.
- Claude Code: keep the folder in a local skills directory or a compatible plugin source.
- Codex: install or sync the folder into
  `$CODEX_HOME/skills/breaking-changes-management` and restart Codex after major changes.

## MCP Availability And Fallback

Preferred MCP Server: None required

- Fallback prompt: "Use the Breaking Changes Management skill without MCP. Rely on its local instructions, bundled resources, standard shell or editor tools, and direct verification. Show the evidence used before concluding."
- Do not claim an MCP operation was used when the active host does not expose it.
- Treat local files, tests, rendered outputs, logs, or screenshots as the fallback evidence path.

<!-- MCP:END -->

## Anti-Patterns

- Starting work before the plan or gate is clear: Execution drifts when success criteria are implied instead of explicit.
- Treating verification as optional cleanup: The last mile is where regressions and missing updates are usually hiding.
- Mixing planning, implementation, and release work in one jump: You lose the causal chain that explains why a change is safe.

## Verification Protocol

Before claiming "skill applied successfully":

1. Pass/fail: The Breaking Changes Management workflow starts from explicit success criteria, constraints, and stop conditions.
2. Pass/fail: Required evidence is collected before any completion, approval, or readiness claim.
3. Pass/fail: The next action follows the documented gate order without skipping review or verification steps.
4. Pressure-test scenario: Apply the workflow under time pressure with one failing check and one tempting shortcut.
5. Success metric: Zero rationalizations; blocked, failed, or unverified work is reported as such.

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Old behavior described precisely
- [ ] New behavior described precisely
- [ ] Replacement path documented
- [ ] Upgrade steps ordered and testable
- [ ] Rollback or compatibility notes included
- [ ] README/setup docs updated if user-facing behavior changed
