# Stitch Build Loop

This skill is a catalog-normalized import from `https://github.com/google-labs-code/stitch-skills` at commit `7b53207b94e62911777d53d4238b5f8c88c2b519`, source path `plugins/stitch-utilities/skills/stitch-loop`. The upstream control file was corrected for this workspace: the verified Stitch MCP surface here is design-system oriented, so screen lookup, screen generation, and screen editing tools must be used only when the current host explicitly exposes them.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when a multi-page site should be built iteratively with Stitch and baton files.
- The task involves Google Stitch project IDs, `.stitch/` artifacts, DESIGN.md files, Stitch exports, or Stitch-specific validation.
- The broader `stitch-design` router points here as the narrowest workflow.

## Workflow

1. Read `.stitch/next-prompt.md`, `.stitch/SITE.md`, and `.stitch/DESIGN.md` before generating or integrating pages.
2. Use `stitch-generate-design` for screen prompts when tools or the Stitch web UI are available.
3. When screen-generation MCP tools are absent, prepare the next prompt and record that the web UI/API step is required.
4. Move generated or exported HTML into the site only after checking the sitemap.
5. Run local browser verification when a page is integrated into a runnable site.
6. Update SITE.md, metadata, and `next-prompt.md` before closing the loop.

## Local Assets

- `examples/`, `resources/`, `references/`, or `reference/` are upstream support material when present. Treat `SKILL.md` as the source of truth if a support file mentions an unavailable MCP tool.
- `scripts/` are optional helpers. On Windows, prefer PowerShell or Node equivalents unless Git Bash or WSL is actually available.
- Keep generated `.stitch/` files out of commits unless the user explicitly wants them as durable examples.

## Corrected Stitch MCP Surface

Verified in this workspace on 2026-06-15: `create_project`, `upload_design_md`, `create_design_system_from_design_md`, `list_design_systems`, and `apply_design_system`. This 2026-07-29 source refresh did not re-verify a broader live MCP surface. Do not claim `list_projects`, `list_screens`, `get_project`, `get_screen`, `generate_screen_from_text`, `edit_screens`, or `generate_variants` were used unless the current host exposes those exact tools in the active tool list.

## Cross-Client Portability

This skill is written to stay usable across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Codex.

- GitHub Copilot: keep the folder in a Copilot-visible skill path or wrap the
  workflow in project instructions when folder discovery is unavailable.
- Claude Code: keep the folder in a local skills directory or a compatible plugin source.
- Codex: install or sync the folder into
  `$CODEX_HOME/skills/stitch-loop` and restart Codex after major changes.

## MCP Availability And Fallback

Preferred MCP Server: Stitch MCP

- Fallback prompt: "Use the Stitch Build Loop skill without MCP. Follow the documented local or manual fallback, show the selected tool surface, and report the verification evidence."
- Use local `.stitch/` artifacts, exported HTML or screenshots, bundled scripts, and the Stitch web UI when the host does not expose the needed Stitch MCP operation.
- Do not claim screen lookup, generation, editing, or variant MCP calls unless those tools are present in the active host tool list.
- Do not claim an MCP operation was used when the active host does not expose it.

<!-- MCP:END -->

## Anti-Patterns

- Claiming a Stitch screen-generation, screen-editing, or screen-retrieval MCP call succeeded when the active host does not expose that tool.
- Uploading files, screenshots, HTML, markdown, or design assets to Stitch without user-approved destination and artifact details.
- Reading, printing, storing, or committing Stitch API keys, MCP config secrets, cookies, or credential-bearing files.
- Treating generated design or code as final without local render, syntax, or artifact verification.
- Collapsing this workflow into a broader frontend/design skill when Stitch-specific files, project IDs, or design-system assets matter.

## Verification Protocol

Before claiming this skill was applied successfully:

1. Pass/fail: Baton frontmatter has a page slug and concrete task body.
2. Pass/fail: SITE.md reflects sitemap, completed pages, and next backlog item.
3. Pass/fail: Generated or integrated pages were checked locally or unavailable generation is recorded.
4. Pass/fail: The loop leaves a next baton for the following session.
5. Pressure-test scenario: Repeat the workflow with Stitch MCP screen tools unavailable and confirm the fallback path remains honest and actionable.
6. Success metric: The user can identify the exact artifact, project/design-system target, and verification evidence without relying on unstated MCP behavior.
