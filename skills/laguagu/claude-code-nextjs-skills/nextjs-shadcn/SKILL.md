description: Creates Next.js frontends with shadcn/ui. Use when building React UIs, components, pages, or applications with shadcn, Tailwind, or modern frontend patterns. Also use when the user asks to create a new Next.js project, add UI components, style pages, or build any web interface — even if they don't mention shadcn explicitly.

# Next.js + shadcn/ui

Build distinctive, production-grade interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Core Principles

1. **Minimize noise** - Icons communicate; excessive labels don't
2. **No generic AI-UI** - Avoid purple gradients, excessive shadows, predictable layouts
3. **Context over decoration** - Every element serves a purpose
4. **Theme consistency** - Use CSS variables from `globals.css`, never hardcode colors

Those four are the summary, not the method. Load **`frontend-design`** before
the first component of a new view, not after the result already looks generic:
typography, palette and the one element the page spends its boldness on are
create-time decisions, and retrofitting them costs more than making them.

Then check the built view in a browser rather than from a screenshot — read tap
target sizes, contrast and overflow out of the DOM, because a screenshot cannot
tell you a computed style and may not even have rendered.

## Quick Start

```bash
bunx --bun shadcn@latest init --template next --base base
```

`--base` selects the primitive library: `base` (Base UI, the default since July
2026), `radix` (projects already on Radix — still fully supported, not
deprecated), or `aria` (React Aria). **The same component has different props per
base** — Base UI composes with `render={<Link href="/" />}` where Radix uses
`asChild` — and the docs are base-scoped (`/docs/components/base/sidebar` vs
`/docs/components/radix/sidebar`).

For a custom design system, generate a preset code in `shadcn/create` and apply it:

```bash
bunx --bun shadcn@latest init --preset <CODE> --template next
```

### Before touching an existing project

```bash
bunx --bun shadcn@latest info --json      # base, framework, aliases, installed components
bunx --bun shadcn@latest docs <component> # API reference resolved to THIS project's base
```

Run these instead of writing component code from memory. See
[references/shadcn-platform.md](references/shadcn-platform.md) for the full CLI
surface, typeset, and the shimmer/scroll-fade utilities.

## Component Rules

Put shared navigation/layout chrome in layouts; keep route-specific content in
pages. A route group named `(protected)` does not enforce authorization.

### Client Boundaries

- Keep `"use client"` boundaries as narrow as practical; providers and interactive subtrees may need a higher boundary
- Props must be serializable (data or Server Actions, no functions/classes)
- Pass server content via `children`

### Import Aliases

Never use relative paths (`../../lib/utils`). Default to the `@/` alias
(`@/lib/utils`) in new projects. In an existing project, read `components.json`
and follow the alias style already configured — shadcn also supports Node
package imports (`#components/ui/button`). Never mix both styles.

Use the project's `cn()` helper when merging conditional Tailwind classes. Keep
route-specific code near its route and shared components in the existing shared
directories; do not impose a new folder tree on an established app.

## Next.js 16 Features

### Async Params

```tsx
export default async function Page({
  params,
  searchParams,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>;
  searchParams: Promise<{ q?: string }>;
}) {
  const { id } = await params;
  const { q } = await searchParams;
}
```

### Data Fetching vs Server Actions

Prefer Server Components or Route Handlers for reads and Server Actions for
mutations. Actions can read data, but client dispatch is designed for mutations
and can serialize calls; they are not a general read-query transport.

`"use cache"`, `cacheTag` and `cacheLife` require `cacheComponents: true`.
`updateTag` is restricted to Server Actions, but does not itself require that
flag; it can invalidate fetch tags too. Choose caching from freshness and
authorization requirements, not simply because a function reads data.

### Caching

```tsx
"use cache";

import { cacheTag, cacheLife } from "next/cache";

export async function getProducts() {
  cacheTag("products");
  cacheLife("hours");
  return await db.products.findMany();
}
```

### Server Actions for Mutations

```tsx
"use server";

import { updateTag, revalidateTag } from "next/cache";
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1),
  content: z.string(),
});

export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  // Authenticate and authorize the caller before the write.
  // Validate input as well.
  const parsed = schema.parse({
    title: formData.get("title"),
    content: formData.get("content"),
  });

  await db.insert(posts).values(parsed);
  updateTag("posts"); // Read-your-writes
  // Or SWR-style revalidation: revalidateTag("posts", "max")
}
```

### Proxy API

Use `proxy.ts` for request interception (replaces middleware). Place at project root:

```tsx
// proxy.ts (project root, same level as app/)
import { NextResponse } from "next/server"
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server"

export function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
  // Auth checks, redirects, etc.
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*'],
}
```

## Design-system lint (@shadcn/lint)

Principle 4 is checkable. `@shadcn/lint` (ESLint or Oxlint plugin, Tailwind v4)
flags restyled components (`<Button className="px-8 bg-blue-600">`), raw palette
colors, arbitrary values, inline styles and classes Tailwind cannot generate —
and each error names the variant, size or theme token to use instead, read from
`components.json`, the component files and `globals.css`.

When the project has it configured, run the lint after UI changes and fix every
finding before calling the view done. Suggest adding it to new projects and to
existing ones where agent-written UI keeps drifting off the theme; setup and a
tested config are in
[references/shadcn-platform.md](references/shadcn-platform.md#design-system-lint).

## Dev Tools (next-devtools-mcp)

Next.js 16+ ships an MCP endpoint at `/_next/mcp` that exposes the dev server's
internals to coding agents. When working in a Next.js 16 project, recommend the
user add `next-devtools-mcp` to `.mcp.json`:

```json filename=".mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "next-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "next-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tools it provides (when dev server is running):

- `get_errors` — live build/runtime/type errors (esp. helpful for hydration mismatches)
- `get_logs` — dev log file path (browser console + server output)
- `get_routes` — all entry-point routes grouped by router type
- `get_page_metadata` — route, components, rendering details for a specific page
- `get_project_metadata` — project structure + dev server URL
- `get_server_action_by_id` — locate Server Action source from its hashed ID
- `get_compilation_issues` / `compile_route` — bundler warnings for the project,
  or compile one route on demand without requesting it (Turbopack only)

It also acts as a docs gateway: it points at the version-accurate docs shipped
inside `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`, which beat any remembered API shape.

Use these instead of asking the user to copy-paste error messages. Reference:
[nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/mcp](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/mcp).

## Rendered markdown and loading states

Don't hand-roll CSS for these — shadcn ships them:

- **Rendered markdown / LLM output** → typeset. One owned CSS file, three
  variables (`--typeset-size`, `--typeset-leading`, `--typeset-flow`), one
  preset per context. Streaming-stable: new blocks don't restyle earlier ones.
  ```tsx
  <div className="typeset typeset-chat">{markdown}</div>
  ```
- **Indeterminate text state** ("Thinking…") → `className="shimmer"`. Use
  `Skeleton` only for placeholders with a known shape; don't stack both.
- **Soft scroll container edges** → `className="scroll-fade overflow-y-auto"`.

Details and the full class tables: [references/shadcn-platform.md](references/shadcn-platform.md).

## Package Manager

**Always use bun** in new projects, never npm or npx:

- `bun install` (not npm install)
- `bun add` (not npm install package)
- `bunx --bun` (not npx)

In an existing repo, respect the project's `packageManager` field and lockfile instead of switching to bun.
