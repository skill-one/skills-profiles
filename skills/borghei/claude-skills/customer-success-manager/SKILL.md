## Output Formats

All scripts support two output formats via the `--format` flag:

- **`text`** (default): Human-readable formatted output for terminal viewing
- **`json`**: Machine-readable JSON output for integrations and pipelines

---

## Clarify First

Before running the analysis, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Which analysis** — health score, churn risk, or expansion opportunity (selects which of the three scripts and its input schema)
- [ ] **Customer segment** — Enterprise / Mid-Market / SMB (segment-aware thresholds change every Red/Yellow/Green and risk-tier cutoff)
- [ ] **Previous-period data availability** — without it, trend analysis (declining vs improving) cannot run
- [ ] **Renewal date / contract end** — drives the time-to-renewal urgency multiplier in churn scoring

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the output.

## Scripts

### 1. health_score_calculator.py

**Purpose:** Multi-dimensional customer health scoring with trend analysis and segment-aware benchmarking.

**Dimensions and Weights:**
| Dimension | Weight | Metrics |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Usage | 30% | Login frequency, feature adoption, DAU/MAU ratio |
| Engagement | 25% | Support ticket volume, meeting attendance, NPS/CSAT |
| Support | 20% | Open tickets, escalation rate, avg resolution time |
| Relationship | 25% | Executive sponsor engagement, multi-threading depth, renewal sentiment |

**Classification:**
- Green (75-100): Healthy -- customer achieving value
- Yellow (50-74): Needs attention -- monitor closely
- Red (0-49): At risk -- immediate intervention required

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/health_score_calculator.py customer_data.json
python scripts/health_score_calculator.py customer_data.json --format json
```

### 2. churn_risk_analyzer.py

**Purpose:** Identify at-risk accounts with behavioral signal detection and tier-based intervention recommendations.

**Risk Signal Weights:**
| Signal Category | Weight | Indicators |
|----------------|--------|------------|
| Usage Decline | 30% | Login trend, feature adoption change, DAU/MAU change |
| Engagement Drop | 25% | Meeting cancellations, response time, NPS change |
| Support Issues | 20% | Open escalations, unresolved critical, satisfaction trend |
| Relationship Signals | 15% | Champion left, sponsor change, competitor mentions |
| Commercial Factors | 10% | Contract type, pricing complaints, budget cuts |

**Risk Tiers:**
- Critical (80-100): Immediate executive escalation
- High (60-79): Urgent CSM intervention
- Medium (40-59): Proactive outreach
- Low (0-39): Standard monitoring

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/churn_risk_analyzer.py customer_data.json
python scripts/churn_risk_analyzer.py customer_data.json --format json
```

### 3. expansion_opportunity_scorer.py

| Reference | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `references/health-scoring-framework.md` | Complete health scoring methodology, dimension definitions, weighting rationale, threshold calibration |
| `references/cs-playbooks.md` | Intervention playbooks for each risk tier, onboarding, renewal, expansion, and escalation procedures |
| `references/cs-metrics-benchmarks.md` | Industry benchmarks for NRR, GRR, churn rates, health scores, expansion rates by segment and industry |

## Templates

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `assets/qbr_template.md` | Quarterly Business Review presentation structure |
| `assets/success_plan_template.md` | Customer success plan with goals, milestones, and metrics |
| `assets/onboarding_checklist_template.md` | 90-day onboarding checklist with phase gates |
| `assets/executive_business_review_template.md` | Executive stakeholder review for strategic accounts |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Score regularly**: Run health scoring weekly for Enterprise, bi-weekly for Mid-Market, monthly for SMB
2. **Act on trends, not snapshots**: A declining Green is more urgent than a stable Yellow
3. **Combine signals**: Use all three scripts together for a complete customer picture
4. **Calibrate thresholds**: Adjust segment benchmarks based on your product and industry
5. **Document interventions**: Track what actions you took and outcomes for playbook refinement
6. **Prepare with data**: Run scripts before every QBR and executive meeting

---

## Limitations

- **No real-time data**: Scripts analyze point-in-time snapshots from JSON input files
- **No CRM integration**: Data must be exported manually from your CRM/CS platform
- **Deterministic only**: No predictive ML -- scoring is algorithmic based on weighted signals
- **Threshold tuning**: Default thresholds are industry-standard but may need calibration for your business
- **Revenue estimates**: Expansion revenue estimates are approximations based on usage patterns

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Health scores do not correlate with actual churn | Default thresholds do not match your product | Calibrate segment thresholds using historical churn data; compare 90-day retained vs churned cohorts |
| All accounts show as Yellow | Thresholds too strict or data quality issues | Review input data completeness; adjust benchmarks in health_score_calculator.py constants for your industry |
| Churn risk scores are uniformly low | Missing key signals (champion left, competitor mentions) | Ensure all signal categories have data; missing data defaults to low risk, which understates actual risk |
| Expansion scores do not reflect reality | Product usage data is incomplete or stale | Verify product_usage fields cover all modules; run with fresh data exports from your product analytics |
| Scripts error on input data | JSON format does not match expected schema | Reference the Input Requirements section for exact JSON structure; validate JSON before running |
| Trend analysis shows no change | Previous period data not provided | Include the previous_period block in health score input for meaningful trend comparison |
| Intervention recommendations feel generic | Segment is not specified | Always include the segment field (enterprise, mid-market, smb) for segment-appropriate playbooks |

---

## Success Criteria

- Health scores run weekly for Enterprise, bi-weekly for Mid-Market, monthly for SMB accounts
- Portfolio health distribution: 60%+ Green, less than 15% Red
- Churn risk critical accounts have executive escalation within 48 hours
- Expansion pipeline generated covers 20%+ of net retention target
- Health score trends (improving/declining) drive proactive outreach before renewal window
- QBR preparation includes health score, risk assessment, and expansion opportunities for every strategic account
- Intervention playbooks followed for all High and Critical risk accounts

---

## Scope & Limitations

- **In scope:** Customer health scoring, churn risk analysis, expansion opportunity identification, segment benchmarking, trend analysis, QBR preparation
- **Out of scope:** CRM integration, real-time monitoring, predictive ML modeling, automated outreach
- **Data dependency:** Scripts analyze point-in-time JSON snapshots; data must be exported manually from your CRM/CS platform
- **Deterministic scoring:** All analysis is algorithmic based on weighted signals -- no machine learning predictions
- **Threshold tuning:** Default thresholds are industry-standard benchmarks; calibrate for your specific product and customer base
- **Revenue estimates:** Expansion revenue estimates are approximations based on usage patterns, not binding forecasts

---

## Integration Points

- **churn-prevention** -- High-risk accounts from churn_risk_analyzer.py should trigger cancel flow optimization and save offer review
- **revenue-operations** -- Expansion opportunities feed into pipeline forecasting; health scores inform forecast confidence
- **onboarding-cro** -- When health scores show low usage in early lifecycle, the root cause is often poor activation
- **pricing-strategy** -- When expansion analysis reveals pricing as a barrier to upsell, feed into pricing-strategy for packaging review
- **competitive-teardown** -- When churn risk signals include competitor mentions, use teardown data to build counter-positioning
