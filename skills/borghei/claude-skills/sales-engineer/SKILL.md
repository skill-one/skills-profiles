| Win Rate | Deals won / total opportunities | >30% |
| Sales Cycle Length | Average days from discovery to close | <90 days |
| POC Conversion Rate | POCs resulting in closed deals | >60% |
| Customer Engagement Score | Stakeholder participation in evaluation | >75% |
| RFP Coverage Score | Requirements fully addressed | >80% |

## Clarify First

Before producing the deliverable, confirm these inputs. If any is unknown or vague, ASK — do not assume:

- [ ] **Which deliverable** — RFP/RFI coverage analysis, competitive matrix, or POC plan (selects the tool and phase)
- [ ] **Customer requirements + priorities** — the must/should/nice-to-have list (drives weighted coverage and the bid/no-bid call)
- [ ] **Competitor(s) in the deal** — needed for the feature matrix, differentiators, and battlecard
- [ ] **POC scope + success criteria** — when planning a POC, the use cases and measurable go/no-go bar (prevents an unbounded POC)

Stop rule: ask only the 2-3 that most change the output. If the user says "just draft it," proceed and list your assumptions at the top of the deliverable.

## 5-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery & Research

**Objective:** Understand customer requirements, technical environment, and business drivers.

**Activities:**
1. Conduct technical discovery calls with stakeholders
2. Map customer's current architecture and pain points
3. Identify integration requirements and constraints
4. Document security and compliance requirements
5. Assess competitive landscape for this opportunity

**Tools:** Use `rfp_response_analyzer.py` to score initial requirement alignment.

**Output:** Technical discovery document, requirement map, initial coverage assessment.

### Phase 2: Solution Design

**Objective:** Design a solution architecture that addresses customer requirements.

**Activities:**
1. Map product capabilities to customer requirements
2. Design integration architecture
3. Identify customization needs and development effort
4. Build competitive differentiation strategy
5. Create solution architecture diagrams

**Tools:** Use `competitive_matrix_builder.py` to identify differentiators and vulnerabilities.

**Output:** Solution architecture, competitive positioning, technical differentiation strategy.

### Phase 3: Demo Preparation & Delivery

**Objective:** Deliver compelling technical demonstrations tailored to stakeholder priorities.

**Activities:**
1. Build demo environment matching customer's use case
2. Create demo script with talking points per stakeholder role
3. Prepare objection handling responses
4. Rehearse failure scenarios and recovery paths
5. Collect feedback and adjust approach

**Templates:** Use `demo_script_template.md` for structured demo preparation.

**Output:** Customized demo, stakeholder-specific talking points, feedback capture.

### Phase 4: POC & Evaluation

**Objective:** Execute a structured proof-of-concept that validates the solution.

**Activities:**
1. Define POC scope, success criteria, and timeline
2. Allocate resources and set up environment
3. Execute phased testing (core, advanced, edge cases)
4. Track progress against success criteria
5. Generate evaluation scorecard

**Tools:** Use `poc_planner.py` to generate the complete POC plan.

**Templates:** Use `poc_scorecard_template.md` for evaluation tracking.

**Output:** POC plan, evaluation scorecard, go/no-go recommendation.

### Phase 5: Proposal & Closing

**Objective:** Deliver a technical proposal that supports the commercial close.

**Activities:**
1. Compile POC results and success metrics
2. Create technical proposal with implementation plan
3. Address outstanding objections with evidence
4. Support pricing and packaging discussions
5. Conduct win/loss analysis post-decision

**Templates:** Use `technical_proposal_template.md` for the proposal document.

**Output:** Technical proposal, implementation timeline, risk mitigation plan.

## Python Automation Tools

### 1. RFP Response Analyzer

**Script:** `scripts/rfp_response_analyzer.py`

**Purpose:** Parse RFP/RFI requirements, score coverage, identify gaps, and generate bid/no-bid recommendations.

**Coverage Categories:**
- **Full (100%)** - Requirement fully met by current product
- **Partial (50%)** - Requirement partially met, workaround or configuration needed
- **Planned (25%)** - On product roadmap, not yet available
- **Gap (0%)** - Not supported, no current plan

**Priority Weighting:**
- Must-Have: 3x weight
- Should-Have: 2x weight
- Nice-to-Have: 1x weight

**Bid/No-Bid Logic:**
- **Bid:** Coverage score >70% AND must-have gaps <=3
- **Conditional Bid:** Coverage score 50-70% OR must-have gaps 2-3
- **No-Bid:** Coverage score <50% OR must-have gaps >3

**Usage:**
```bash
# Human-readable output
python scripts/rfp_response_analyzer.py assets/sample_rfp_data.json

# JSON output
python scripts/rfp_response_analyzer.py assets/sample_rfp_data.json --format json

# Help
python scripts/rfp_response_analyzer.py --help
```

**Input Format:** See `assets/sample_rfp_data.json` for the complete schema.

### 2. Competitive Matrix Builder

**Script:** `scripts/competitive_matrix_builder.py`

**Purpose:** Generate feature comparison matrices, calculate competitive scores, identify differentiators and vulnerabilities.

**Feature Scoring:**
- **Full (3)** - Complete feature support
- **Partial (2)** - Partial or limited feature support
- **Limited (1)** - Minimal or basic feature support
- **None (0)** - Feature not available

**Usage:**
```bash
# Human-readable output
python scripts/competitive_matrix_builder.py competitive_data.json

# JSON output
python scripts/competitive_matrix_builder.py competitive_data.json --format json
```

**Output Includes:**
- Feature comparison matrix with scores
- Weighted competitive scores per product
- Differentiators (features where our product leads)
- Vulnerabilities (features where competitors lead)
- Win themes based on differentiators

### 3. POC Planner

**Script:** `scripts/poc_planner.py`

**Purpose:** Generate structured POC plans with timeline, resource allocation, success criteria, and evaluation scorecards.

**Default Phase Breakdown:**
- **Week 1:** Setup - Environment provisioning, data migration, configuration
- **Weeks 2-3:** Core Testing - Primary use cases, integration testing
- **Week 4:** Advanced Testing - Edge cases, performance, security
- **Week 5:** Evaluation - Scorecard completion, stakeholder review, go/no-go

**Usage:**
```bash
# Human-readable output
python scripts/poc_planner.py poc_data.json

# JSON output
python scripts/poc_planner.py poc_data.json --format json
```

**Output Includes:**
- POC plan with phased timeline
- Resource allocation (SE, engineering, customer)
- Success criteria with measurable metrics

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| RFP coverage score below 50% triggering No-Bid | Product gaps in must-have requirements or incorrect coverage assessment | Review gap items -- distinguish true gaps from items addressable via configuration, integration, or roadmap commitment; reassess before declining |
| Competitive matrix shows vulnerabilities in 3+ categories | Product gaps relative to a specific competitor, or scoring does not reflect actual competitive dynamics | Validate scoring with field SEs who have competed against this vendor; focus battlecard on differentiators where you lead, not where you trail |
| POC-to-close conversion below 60% | POC scope too broad, success criteria not aligned with buyer priorities, or wrong stakeholders involved | Narrow POC to 3-5 use cases tied to buyer's stated pain; get written agreement on success criteria before starting; ensure executive sponsor participates in evaluation |
| Win rate below 30% | Technical win but commercial loss, late involvement in deal, or poor discovery leading to misaligned demos | Engage earlier in sales cycle; improve discovery quality using MEDDIC framework; align demo storyline to buyer's language not product features |
| Demo-to-POC conversion below 40% | Demo did not address buyer's specific use case or was too generic | Customize every demo to buyer's stated requirements; use their data or industry-specific scenarios; include Q&A and next-step proposal at end |
| RFP response time exceeds 2 weeks | Manual response process without templates or pre-built content library | Build a response library indexed by requirement category; use rfp_response_analyzer.py to prioritize effort on must-have items |
| Stakeholder engagement score below 75% | Key decision-makers not involved in technical evaluation | Map stakeholder roles early; ensure executive briefing alongside technical deep-dives; send personalized follow-up to each stakeholder |

---

## Success Criteria

- Win rate exceeds 30% across all competitive opportunities
- Sales cycle length stays below 90 days from discovery to close
- POC-to-close conversion rate exceeds 60%
- RFP coverage score averages above 80% for opportunities pursued (bid decisions working correctly)
- Competitive matrix identifies minimum 3 clear differentiators per competitor
- Customer engagement score exceeds 75% (measured by stakeholder participation in evaluation milestones)
- Average RFP response time drops below 5 business days with structured response library

---

## Scope & Limitations

**In scope:** RFP/RFI response analysis and scoring, competitive feature matrix construction, proof-of-concept planning and evaluation, demo preparation frameworks, technical proposal structure, win/loss analysis methodology, and stakeholder engagement tracking across the 5-phase pre-sales workflow (Discovery, Solution Design, Demo, POC, Proposal).

**Out of scope:** Sales strategy and territory planning (account executive function), pricing and commercial terms negotiation (use pricing-strategy), post-sale implementation and customer success (use customer-success-manager), marketing content and competitive messaging (use marketing skills), and product roadmap decisions based on RFP gaps (use product-team). Tools analyze static data exports -- no integrations with CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot) or RFP platforms (Loopio, Arphie).

**Limitations:** Bid/no-bid thresholds are configurable but defaults assume B2B SaaS with 30%+ win-rate targets. Competitive matrix scoring is only as accurate as the input data -- validate scores with field experience against specific competitors. POC timelines assume standard 5-week engagement; highly regulated industries (healthcare, government) may require 2-3x longer. AI-assisted RFP tools (emerging in 2025-2026) can reduce response time 60-80% but are not integrated here.

## Integration Points

- **revenue-operations** -- Pipeline deals requiring technical validation flow through SE workflow; SE win/loss data feeds pipeline analysis
- **customer-success-manager** -- POC results and success criteria hand off to CSM for post-close adoption tracking
- **pricing-strategy** -- Competitive pricing data from matrix builder informs pricing positioning decisions
- **product-team** -- RFP gaps flagged as "Planned" or "Gap" feed into product roadmap prioritization
- **c-level-advisor** -- Strategic deals requiring executive engagement escalate through C-level advisory workflow
- **marketing** -- Competitive intelligence from marketing feeds into battlecard creation and positioning
