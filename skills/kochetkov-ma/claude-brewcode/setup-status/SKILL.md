# Setup Status

Read-only cross-analysis over every **setup skill** in the brewcode suite. It answers one question:
*what is already set up in this project, what drifted, what was never installed* — and hands back the
exact command to run for each row.

**Every probe is read-only.** No file is created, edited or deleted by the report itself;
`allowed-tools` carries no `Write`, no `Edit`, no `Agent`. Each probe is an existence check, a `cmp`,
or a one-line grep. The single exception is Phase 1c's opt-in one-key merge into a `settings.json`,
which happens only after the user picks it — see *Why it does not run the setups*.

## Prompt contract

Position 1 of `$ARGUMENTS` is a **free-form prompt** (RU/EN). This skill has no modes to select —
report is the only behavior — so the prompt carries exactly one optional decision: which plugin or
skill to filter to.

1. There are no flags and no destructive path — nothing to strip.
2. Extract a plugin name (`brewcode`, `brewtools`, `brewdoc`) or a skill name (`semble-setup`,
   `docsync`, `task board`, ...) from the prompt if one is present; that becomes the filter. Prose
   naming neither is unrecognised text, not an error -> full report.
3. Empty arguments -> full cross-plugin report. Nothing here is chosen by asking.
4. `AskUserQuestion` fires at most ONCE per run, and only for Phase 1c's task-tools offer — the one
   outcome-changing choice this skill has. The filter is never asked about.
5. Prose that is not a plugin/skill name is still input: extract the name from it, never treat the
   first word as a positional filter.

Then print this block ONCE, right before the report (Phase 4) — the only possible mutation is the
Phase 1c env key, and it comes after the report:

```
PLAN — brewcode:setup-status
INPUT:  <arguments verbatim, or "(empty)">
MODE:   report — <full cross-plugin | filtered: <plugin/skill>>
SCOPE:  <resolved plugin(s)/skill(s) in scope>
DO:     <2-5 imperative bullets: resolve plugin roots, probe artifacts, read stamps, classify;
         add "offer to enable the task-graph tools" when Phase 1c's verdict is `off`>
RESULT: <the report the user ends up holding; name the settings.json write when one is offered>
```

Labels are literal; values follow the conversation language.

## Why it does not run the setups

Each setup skill is an interactive generator: it fans out subagents, analyses the repo and asks the
user real questions. Running two of them back-to-back in one session degrades both — the context
fills with the first one's analysis, and the second one's questions get answered against stale
findings. So the correct flow is:

> **This skill reports. The user runs each setup by hand, ideally one per fresh session.**

There is no `--run`, no `--fix`, no auto mode, and no plan to add one. If the user asks for one, say
this paragraph and print the run-list instead.

> **One carve-out, and it is not a setup.** Phase 1c's `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS` offer merges
> ONE key into ONE `settings.json`. It spawns no subagent, analyses nothing, generates nothing, and
> asks exactly one question — none of the properties that make batching setups harmful apply to it.
> The promise above is about the eleven setups and stays whole: this skill still runs none of them.

Outside that single env key, this skill creates, edits and deletes nothing.

**Arguments:** `$ARGUMENTS` — empty = full report. A plugin name (`brewcode`, `brewtools`, `brewdoc`)
filters to that plugin's rows. A skill name (`semble-setup`, `docsync`, `task board`) filters to
that one row and prints its detection rule in full. Unrecognised text = full report.

## Two questions, two signals

Every setup artifact in a project carries a `content_version` — the release in which its own content
last actually changed — alongside a `version` — the plugin release that produced this install. The
field contract (`version`, `content_version`, `generated_by`, `last_updated`, `doc_type`, and which
carrier each file type uses) lives in ONE place:
[`references/artifact-metadata.md`](references/artifact-metadata.md). This skill consumes it and
never restates it.

| Signal | The question it answers | Read from |
|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| **content_version stamp** — the headline | *has this artifact's own content moved since it was installed here?* | the artifact's own `content_version` field, compared against the plugin's current `content_version` for that same artifact |
| **owner stamp** — the third signal | *did the setup that OWNS this path actually write it?* | the artifact's own `generated_by`, compared against the roster row's `<plugin>:<skill>` |
| **`cmp` vs the plugin asset** — corroborating | *was this file actually re-copied after the plugin update?* | byte equality against `$BC` / `$BT` / `$BD` |

`version` — which plugin release produced this install — stays readable on every row and every
verdict; it answers a real question, just not this skill's headline one, since it bumps on every
plugin release whether or not this artifact's own content changed, which is exactly what was
producing false `stale` reports before `content_version` existed. Report `content_version` first,
`version` beside it as provenance, the owner when it disagrees, the byte verdict last.

None answers another's question. A hand-edited installed hook still carries the `X.Y.Z`
`content_version` stamp it was copied with, so the stamp cannot see body drift — `cmp` can. And `cmp`
is meaningless for a generated artifact, which is AI-authored per project and never byte-equal to any
asset — only the stamp reaches those. The owner is orthogonal to both: a file written by the WRONG
setup can be at the current `content_version` and byte-perfect, and nothing but `generated_by` will
say so.

Of the five fields in the contract, this skill reads three — `content_version` (headline),
`generated_by`, and `version` (secondary, displayed but never decisive). Why `last_updated` and
`doc_type` are deliberately unread is argued once, in Phase 2a; do not add a reader for them without
an actionable verdict to attach.

Two stamping moments, and the difference matters when reading a row:

| Artifact kind | Stamped | Consequence |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| byte-copied asset (`.mjs`, `.sh`, `semble-first.md`) | **baked at release** by `bump-version.sh` | the installed copy stays byte-identical to the plugin asset, so `cmp` keeps working alongside the stamp |
| generated artifact (emitted `SKILL.md`, `team.md`, `config.json`) | **substituted at install** | no `cmp` partner exists; the stamp is the only version signal |
| byte-copied asset the install then FILLS (`memory-sync`'s `references/hard-sync.md`) | **baked at release**, then frozen | it ships as mechanism `a` and is `cp`d verbatim, but the generator's own Phase 3 writes project-specific tables into it afterwards, so the installed copy is legitimately never byte-equal and its stamp is never refreshed. **Neither signal reaches it** — no `cmp`, no stamp read |
| pristine template baseline (`.template-baseline/`) | **not stamped at all** | it holds the raw template, placeholders unresolved, on purpose — never read a version out of it |

---

## The Roster — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

Every fact this skill knows about a setup lives in this ONE table. Adding a future setup = adding
ONE row. Nothing else in this file, and no script, encodes the roster.

| # | Skill (command) | Plugin | Anchor artifact | Secondary artifacts | `content_version` stamp — carrier & how to read (headline; `version` rides along at the same carrier as provenance) | `cmp` corroboration |
|---|-----------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | `/brewcode:teams-setup` | brewcode | `.claude/teams/*/team.md` | `.claude/teams/*/trace.jsonl`, `.claude/teams/*/trace-ops.sh` | `team.md` header table: the `\| Content Version \| X.Y.Z \|` row of the `Field/Value` block is the headline, beside `\| Version \|` (provenance), `\| Generated by \|` and `\| Last update \|`. Generated, substituted at install. **The Agents table also carries a per-agent trailing `Version` column** — `upgrade` rewrites only the rows it touches, so a roster may legitimately mix versions; that per-agent column stays `version`, not `content_version` — it exists to show which write touched each agent, not content drift. The header's `Content Version` row is the headline (content_version of the last real change to `team.md`'s own template); if it is behind the plugin's current `content_version` for that template, say so in *found*. **Confirmed wired** — `scripts/detect-mode.sh:36` self-locates `CONTENT_VERSION` off `teams-setup/SKILL.md`'s own `brewcode-meta:` marker and `SKILL.md:417` writes it into the header row; `verify-team.sh:166` fails a surviving `{CONTENT_VERSION}` token. Compared against `skills/teams-setup/SKILL.md` (the `STAMPS` source), never against the release version. A `team.md` with no `Content Version` row is a pre-5.6 install -> `stale (legacy stamp)` | `trace-ops.sh` vs `$BC/skills/teams-setup/scripts/trace-ops.sh` (byte-copied, meta line baked at release). **Absence signal kept:** complete team with no `trace-ops.sh` = pre-standard install whose agents cannot trace -> `stale`. **Remedy check:** `upgrade`'s U4 rewrites the three header rows from the Phase 1 scalars, and C4 directs `upgrade` to re-`cp` the tracer ("Re-copy it in UPGRADE too (`cp` is idempotent) so a team created by an older version gains it") — so both the stamp and this absence clear. Per-agent `Version` cells move only for agents the run actually touched, which is why a mixed roster stays `installed` |
| 2 | `/brewcode:semble-setup` | brewcode | `.claude/rules/semble-first.md` | `.claude/hooks/semble-session.mjs`, `semble-prefetch.mjs`, `semble-stats.mjs`, `semble-reminder.mjs`, `semble-subagent.mjs`, `.claude/semble/state.json` | frontmatter `content_version:` of `.claude/rules/semble-first.md` — headline; `version:` rides along at the same carrier as provenance. It is a **pure byte-copy**: the template carries baked `doc_type: llm` + `version` + `generated_by` and deliberately no `last_updated`, and the installer does NOT restamp on copy — so the installed rule stays byte-identical to the template and `cmp` must read `SAME`. `DIFFERS` here means a hand-edit or a rule never re-copied after the plugin update, never a stamping artefact | **all FIVE live hooks** vs `$BC/skills/semble-setup/assets/*.mjs` (`semble-explore.mjs` is retired for good, superseded by `semble-subagent.mjs`; if that file is still in `.claude/hooks/` the install predates the migration - report it in *found* and prescribe `upgrade`, never `DIFFERS`), plus the rule vs `assets/semble-first.md.template` — and NOTHING else. **The repo-root `.sembleignore` is byte-copied but never byte-STABLE: it is carved out of the `cmp` set** (its `# brewcode-meta:` stamp IS still read — see the row-2 carve-out below). `.sembleignore` sits at the REPO ROOT, not under `.claude/`, and is absent from installs predating it: report that presence check in *found*, never as a `cmp` verdict. `.claude/semble/state.json` is runtime state — never a stamp source, and its `approvedVersion` is the semble **package** version, not ours. **Wiring is a separate signal from bytes, and it is the one that catches a v1-shaped repo:** `.claude/settings.json` can list a hook that no longer exists, or list five of the six the current version wants, while every file on disk is byte-current. `semble-status.sh` reads it (`guidance.hooks`: `retired[]`, `staleEntries`, `wiredCount`/`wantCount`) and downgrades its own `ready` to `partial` for any of the three; report the same way — retired hooks on disk, stale settings entries, or `wiredCount < wantCount` is `stale`, prescribing `install`, no matter how current the stamps are. `wantCount: 0` means the counts were not reported at all and is never a defect. **This row's setup carries its OWN version signal, and it now asks the same question this dashboard does:** `semble-guidance.sh` computes `rule.content_version` (the installed rule's frontmatter `content_version:`) beside `rule.templateContentVersion` (the plugin template's `content_version:`, read straight off `assets/semble-first.md.template` — the same file this row's `STAMPS` source names), and `semble-status.sh:791-800` drops `ready` -> `partial` on exactly that pair, with `nextStep: Run /brewcode:semble-setup upgrade`. `version` rides along informational-only there, as here. So the two agree by construction; a disagreement is a finding worth naming, not a known gap. **A `partial` from `semble-setup status` whose `nextStep` is `resume` is NOT a version signal** — that ladder means warm/smoke unproven (an offline `install`/`enable` legitimately exits 3 with `"status":"skipped"`) and it never bears on this row's stamp verdict. Both stamps empty (a pre-5.0 unstamped rule) is deliberately NOT stale there; this dashboard's `LEGACY-NONE` still covers it. **Remedy check:** `upgrade` unconditionally re-runs `semble-guidance.sh install --part all` (SKILL.md `### upgrade`), which is the ONLY writer of the rule's stamp — so it does clear `BEHIND`. It also `cp`s the five hooks with no user_modified guard (`install_hook_files`), so hook `DIFFERS` always clears. **`semble-first.md` is the exception:** `install_managed` re-syncs it only when the sole delta is the metadata block, and a real prose hand-edit is SKIPPED with a `diff -u` to stderr. Say so in *found* — that one needs `--force`, which is not a skill mode. `.sembleignore` takes the same skip branch inside the installer, but this dashboard never reaches that verdict for it: it is not `cmp`d at all, so **never prescribe `--force` on `.sembleignore`** — see the carve-out |
| 3 | `/brewcode:superreview-setup` | brewcode | `.claude/skills/superreview/SKILL.md` | `.claude/skills/superreview/references/agent-prompt.md`, `.../report-template.md`, `.../scope.md`, `.claude/skills/superreview/.template-baseline/` | frontmatter `content_version:` of the **emitted** `.claude/skills/superreview/SKILL.md` — headline; `version:` rides along at the same carrier as provenance — substituted at install from `{PLUGIN_VERSION}` / `{CONTENT_VERSION}`. **Confirmed wired** — `generate.sh` `_content_version()` (`:207-216`) self-locates it off `superreview-setup/SKILL.md`'s own marker and HARD-FAILS rather than stamping a placeholder; `:279` substitutes `{CONTENT_VERSION}`, `_restamp_meta` and `validate` (`:861`) both require a quoted `X.Y.Z`. Compared against `skills/superreview-setup/SKILL.md` (the `STAMPS` source). An emitted `SKILL.md` with no `content_version:` is a pre-5.6 install -> `stale (legacy stamp)`. **Never read either version out of `.template-baseline/`** — that dir is the pristine template and its stamps are the unresolved `{PLUGIN_VERSION}`/`{CONTENT_VERSION}` tokens by design, which is precisely why `upgrade` reports IDENTICAL across a version bump instead of a phantom diff. A placeholder in the *emitted* file means substitution never completed -> `partial`. **Remedy check:** `upgrade` restamps FIVE live files unconditionally — `SKILL.md` + `references/{agent-prompt,report-template,scope}.md` + the per-stack ref (`generate.sh` `_restamp_meta` loop) — and prints a `RESTAMP:` line for each even when the delta report says `IDENTICAL`, which is the normal outcome of a plain version bump. So `BEHIND` clears | the 4 baseline copies vs the plugin templates (mapping below) — answers "did the plugin's templates move since this project was tailored", which the emitted stamp cannot. Baseline dir absent -> pre-baseline install, report it in *found*, do not call it a version. **A baseline `DIFFERS` is NOT cleared by `upgrade` alone:** `upgrade` only stages the new templates and prints the promote command (`rm -rf <baseline> && mv <staging>/.template <baseline> && rm -rf <staging>`), which the user runs after porting the delta. Name both halves in the remedy |
| 4 | `/brewtools:task-board-setup` | brewtools | `.claude/features/board.md` | `.claude/agents/task-tracker.md`, `.claude/skills/task-board/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/task-spec/SKILL.md`, `.claude/rules/tasks.md`, `.claude/features/PROGRESS.md` | frontmatter `content_version:` of the anchor itself — headline; `version:` rides along at the same carrier as provenance — `board.md` opens with the key block, substituted at install from `{PLUGIN_VERSION}` / `{CONTENT_VERSION}`. Nine artifacts carry the block: the anchor + the 5 secondaries above, plus `TRACKER.md`, `INDEX.md`, `backlog/README.md`. `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` is deliberately UNSTAMPED — its frontmatter is copied into every task card — so its lack of a stamp is never a defect. **Confirmed wired** — `{CONTENT_VERSION}` is self-located off `task-board-setup/SKILL.md`'s own line-1 `brewcode-meta:` marker (stamped by `bump-version.sh`, kind `marker`), resolved beside `{PLUGIN_VERSION}` in the same "Resolving..." bash block, and substituted into all nine templates. **Remedy check:** `upgrade` step `U5b` (`references/10-upgrade.md:282`) restamps the quartet on all nine unconditionally, and `:109`/`:111` make it run even on the commonest path, where every content row is `SKIP` and the version stamp is the only thing out of date. So `BEHIND` clears | none copied verbatim. **Absence signal kept:** board present but `.claude/skills/task-spec/SKILL.md` missing = install predates the spec+design layer -> `stale`, the documented upgrade path was never run |
| 5 | `/brewtools:think-short-setup` | brewtools | `.claude/hooks/think-short-session.mjs` (project) or `~/.claude/hooks/think-short-session.mjs` (global) | in the same dir: `think-short-prompt-counter.mjs`, `think-short-subagent.mjs`, `think-short-prompt.md`; plus a `think-short` reference in the matching `settings.json` | the `content_version=` token in the `// brewcode-meta:` line right after the shebang of `think-short-session.mjs` is the headline (baked at release by `bump-version.sh`, alongside `version=` as provenance). `think-short-prompt.md` carries the same marker pair as an HTML comment on line 1, not frontmatter. There is no JSON carrier on this row. **Confirmed wired** — all 4 assets are `STAMPED_FILES` in `bump-version.sh`, which now stamps `content_version` into every kind it handles. **Remedy check:** `upgrade` re-emits all four assets from the current plugin version, keeping the disabled state (SKILL.md mode table), so both the stamp and any `DIFFERS` clear | all 4 vs `$BT/skills/think-short-setup/assets/` |
| 6 | `/brewtools:agent-deadline-setup` | brewtools | `.claude/hooks/agent-deadline-guard.mjs` (or the `~/.claude` twin) | `agent-deadline-cleanup.mjs` beside it, `.claude/agent-deadline.json`, `agent-deadline` in `settings.json` | the `content_version=` token in `agent-deadline-guard.mjs`'s `// brewcode-meta:` line (baked at release) is the headline, `version=` beside it as provenance. `.claude/agent-deadline.json` carries the same quartet (`version`, `content_version`, `generated_by`, `last_updated`), copied from `assets/INSTALL.md`'s own header marker at every write — read it too, it is the only carrier that moves when the user runs `enable`/`disable`. **Confirmed wired** — both `INSTALL.md` (its own `content_version=` marker, stamped by `bump-version.sh`) and the JSON write (reads that marker, stamps all 4 keys, verifies with a read-back) are in place. **Remedy check:** `upgrade` replays the install at the SAME budget (`defaultMinutes`/`byAgentType`/`hardStopRatio` read back out of the config), re-copying both hooks and rewriting the JSON trio; a disabled setup stays disabled | both `.mjs` vs `$BT/skills/agent-deadline-setup/assets/` |
| 7 | `/brewtools:agent-router-setup` | brewtools | `.claude/hooks/agent-router.mjs` | `.claude/brewtools/agent-router.json`, `agent-router.mjs` referenced in `.claude/settings.json` | the `content_version=` token in `agent-router.mjs`'s `// brewcode-meta:` line (baked at release) is the headline, `version=` beside it as provenance; `.claude/brewtools/agent-router.json` carries the same quartet (`version`, `content_version`, `generated_by`, `last_updated`), copied from `assets/INSTALL.md`'s own header marker and rewritten by `install`/`upgrade`/`enable`/`disable`/`level` — read it too, it is the only carrier that moves on those. **Confirmed wired** — `INSTALL.md` (its own `content_version=` marker, stamped by `bump-version.sh`) and the JSON write both stamp all 4 keys with a read-back. **Remedy check:** `upgrade` reads `level` back out of the config and replays the install at that level — fresh `agent-router.mjs`, behavior values preserved, metadata re-stamped — so it never asks a question and never changes a setting | the hook vs `$BT/skills/agent-router-setup/assets/agent-router.mjs` |
| 8 | `/brewtools:manager-setup` | brewtools | `.claude/brewtools/manager/state.json` | `.claude/brewtools/manager/hardmode-guard.mjs`, a `hardmode-guard.mjs` PreToolUse entry in `.claude/settings.local.json` | top-level `"content_version"` in the RAW `state.json` is the headline — **confirmed wired**: `writeState()` in `$BT/hooks/lib/manager-state.mjs` stamps it from that module's OWN `brewcode-meta:` marker (`resolveContentVersion()`, `:91-98`) and DELETES the key rather than inventing one when the marker cannot be read (`:273-280`), so it is compared against `hooks/lib/manager-state.mjs` (the `STAMPS` source). When the key is absent, read the RAW file's `"version"` as the fallback headline — read the file, never `resolveState`'s merged view, or a defaulted key would let an old state file inherit the current version and hide the staleness. `writeState()` resolves that `version` from `brewtools/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and falls back to that module's OWN baked `brewcode-meta` line (`pluginVersion()`, `:69-81`), never a literal. `DEFAULT_STATE` deliberately carries no version — it is the answer to "no state file exists", and a version there would be a fake stamp; a project with no state file therefore resolves with no version key at all, which is the `missing` signal, not a version. Second precedence, only when the primary key is absent: the `content_version=` token in the copied `hardmode-guard.mjs`'s `// brewcode-meta:` line (baked at release by `bump-version.sh`, compared against `hooks/hardmode-guard.mjs`). **The precedence holds because the primary carrier MOVES:** `upgrade` calls `writeState('project', {}, cwd)` with an EMPTY partial, and `writeState` stamps `version`/`content_version`/`generated_by`/`last_updated` on every write while `hard`, `level`, `mode` and every unknown key merge through from the existing file. Reading the guard's meta line first would answer a question the state file already answers more precisely. **A second, rarer way the key goes absent, and the reason the fallback is load-bearing rather than historical:** when `pluginVersion()` cannot resolve, `writeState` DELETES `version` rather than stamping `unknown` (`:242-252`) — including a `version` inherited from the older file it is merging over. So an absent key on a freshly written state file is a resolver failure on a current install, NOT a legacy one; the guard's line beneath it is the answer, and re-running `enable`/`disable`/`upgrade` will not put it back. `references/artifact-metadata.md` records why this one writer omits instead of aborting | the copied guard vs `$BT/hooks/hardmode-guard.mjs` — `install` AND `upgrade` both overwrite it every run, so `DIFFERS` means exactly "neither was re-run since the plugin update", and `upgrade` clears it together with the stamp |
| 9 | `/brewdoc:memory-sync-setup` | brewdoc | `.claude/skills/memory-sync/SKILL.md` | `references/memory-guide.md`, `references/agent-audit.md`, `references/hard-sync.md` under it | frontmatter `content_version:` of the emitted `SKILL.md` is the headline — **confirmed wired**: `generate.sh` `resolve_content_version()` (`:38-44`) self-locates it off `memory-sync-setup/SKILL.md`'s own marker, `:84` HARD-FAILS on `unknown`, and it is written into the frontmatter quartet (`:193`) and refreshed by `restamp` (`:489`). Compared against `skills/memory-sync-setup/SKILL.md` (the `STAMPS` source). Read `version:` (quoted), carrying the **brewdoc plugin version**, as the fallback headline on a pre-5.6 anchor that carries no `content_version:`. Empty `version:` + a last line starting `<!-- memory-sync template v` = a **legacy stamp**; empty with no tail stamp = **unstamped**. What was retired from `generate.sh` is the hardcoded per-template counter (`VERSION=1.0.0`), not the `VERSION=` variable; a literal there would be the defect. A skill-specific `surface_files:` key TRAILS the four standard ones; ignore it. **The two byte-copied references are ahead of the anchor:** `memory-guide.md` and `agent-audit.md` ARE in `bump-version.sh`'s `STAMPED_FILES` (kind `md`), so they already carry a real `content_version=` token in their line-1 HTML comment — read it there as corroboration, but never promote a secondary's content_version to the row's headline | **the anchor is generated and has no `cmp` partner; TWO of the three references have one and `hard-sync.md` does NOT.** `generate.sh:398` `cp`s all three verbatim (`EMITTED_REFS`, `:38`) and they are mechanism-`a` byte copies stamped at release with a line-1 HTML-comment `brewcode-meta:` (now including `content_version=`), so exactly two pair up: `.claude/skills/memory-sync/references/memory-guide.md` and `agent-audit.md` vs `$BD/skills/memory-sync-setup/references/<same name>`. `DIFFERS` there = a SELF-SYNC hand-edit or references never re-copied after the plugin update. **`hard-sync.md` is byte-copied but never byte-STABLE — carved out of the `cmp` set and out of the `STAMPS` heredoc alike**; see the carve-out note below. For a deeper diff of the generated anchor, OFFER (never run) `generate.sh status`, see below |
| 10 | `/brewdoc:docsync-setup` | brewdoc | `.claude/docsync/config.json` | `.claude/docsync/state-<session_id>.json`, `.claude/hooks/docsync-track.mjs`, `docsync-watch.mjs`, `docsync-gate.mjs`, `docsync` in `.claude/settings.json` | top-level `"content_version"` of `.claude/docsync/config.json` is the headline — **confirmed wired**: install reads `docsync-setup/SKILL.md`'s own line-10 marker into `CV` and writes it (`docsync-setup/SKILL.md:231-257`), and `upgrade` (`:390-398`) and `enable`/`disable` (`:468-479`) re-stamp the same quartet while leaving `threshold_days`/`exclude` verbatim. Compared against `skills/docsync-setup/SKILL.md` (the `STAMPS` source). Read `"version"` as the fallback headline on a pre-5.6 config that carries no `content_version` key. **`config.json` present but carrying no `version` key either = a pre-standard install = `stale (legacy, unstamped)`**, never `missing`. Corroborating only: the `content_version=` token in the `// brewcode-meta:` line of `.claude/hooks/docsync-track.mjs`, which catches a hook set that was never re-copied. State is runtime and never carries a stamp — it is now ONE FILE PER SESSION, `state-<session_id>.json` (`docsync-track.mjs:60-64`, falling back to `state.json` when no session id), so probe the glob and never treat several of them, or none, as a defect | the 3 hooks vs `$BD/skills/docsync-setup/assets/` |
| 11 | `/brewtools:agent-return-setup` | brewtools | `.claude/hooks/agent-return-guard.mjs` (or the `~/.claude` twin) | `agent-return-contract.mjs` and `agent-return-budget.mjs` beside it, `.claude/agent-return.json`, `agent-return` in `settings.json` | the `content_version=` token in `agent-return-guard.mjs`'s `// brewcode-meta:` line (baked at release) is the headline, `version=` beside it as provenance. `.claude/agent-return.json` carries the same quartet (`version`, `content_version`, `generated_by`, `last_updated`) written by every mode that touches it (`install`, `upgrade`, `enable`, `disable` — `INSTALL.md:208`, `:536`), copied from `INSTALL.md`'s own header marker — read it too, it is the only carrier that moves on an `enable`/`disable`. **Confirmed wired** — `INSTALL.md`'s own marker (stamped by `bump-version.sh`) and the JSON write (stamps all 4 keys, verifies with a read-back) are in place. **Only TWO of the three `.mjs` are ever registered** — `agent-return-budget.mjs` is a shared module imported by both hooks, so it is a file-presence check and must NEVER appear in `settings.json`; a settings ref to it is a defect. `1/3` or `2/3` hook files is `partial`, not `stale`: ESM resolution precedes evaluation, so a missing sibling makes BOTH hooks exit 1 with a hook-error banner on every subagent spawn and return. **Remedy check:** `upgrade` (`INSTALL.md:455-486`) reads `passTokens`/`fileTokens` back out of the config and replays the install for that scope — all three files re-copied, both settings entries re-merged, the JSON trio re-stamped; a disabled setup stays disabled | all THREE `.mjs` vs `$BT/skills/agent-return-setup/assets/` |

`$BC` / `$BT` / `$BD` = the resolved plugin roots from Phase 0.

**Row 3 baseline mapping** (the only non-obvious `cmp` pairing):

| Project baseline copy | Plugin template |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `.claude/skills/superreview/.template-baseline/SKILL.md` | `$BC/skills/superreview-setup/references/SKILL.md.template` |
| `.../.template-baseline/references/agent-prompt.md` | `$BC/skills/superreview-setup/references/agent-prompt.md` |
| `.../.template-baseline/references/report-template.md` | `$BC/skills/superreview-setup/references/report-template.md` |
| `.../.template-baseline/references/scope.md` | `$BC/skills/superreview-setup/references/scope.md.template` |
| `.../.template-baseline/references/<stack>.md` | `$BC/skills/superreview-setup/references/<stack>.md` |

`<stack>` is the one per-stack reference the install picked — `go.md`, `java-kotlin.md`,
`python.md` or `typescript-react.md`. It is substituted and baseline-copied exactly like the
other four; only its filename varies. Absent from an install that predates it: report the other
four and say the per-stack ref is missing, never `DIFFERS`.

### NOT setups — never appear in the report

Recurring tools, not one-time installs. They are correct to run repeatedly and have no installed
state to report: `brewcode:agents`, `skills`, `rules`, `convention`, `e2e`;
`brewtools:text-optimize`, `text-human`, `secrets-scan`, `ssh`, `deploy`, `plugin-update`,
`provider-switch`; `brewdoc:md-to-pdf`, `my-claude`, `publish`.

---

## Phase 0 — Resolve plugin roots

A plugin that is not installed makes every one of its rows `n/a` — never `missing`. Do not assume
all four are present.

The plugin version is the number every stamp is compared against, so resolve it with the SAME
precedence the brewcode SessionStart hook uses (`brewcode/hooks/session-start.mjs`, `parseVersion`):
**the cache directory basename first, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `.version` second.** One
precedence, two consumers — do not invent a third.

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool:

```bash
for p in brewcode brewdoc brewtools brewui; do
  r=$({ ls -d "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-brewcode/$p"/*/ 2>/dev/null || true; } | sort -V | tail -1 | sed 's:/*$::')
  if [ -n "$r" ] && [ -d "$r" ]; then
    v=$(basename "$r")
    case "$v" in
      [0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*) : ;;
      *) v=$(grep -o '"version"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' "$r/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's/.*:[[:space:]]*"//; s/"$//' || true) ;;
    esac
    echo "$p ROOT=$r VERSION=${v:-unknown}"
  else echo "$p ROOT=none VERSION=none"; fi
done
echo "PROJECT=$PWD"
test -d "$PWD/.claude" && echo "DOTCLAUDE=yes" || echo "DOTCLAUDE=no"
echo "OK"
```

> **STOP if FAILED** — cannot resolve the cache; report it and stop rather than calling everything
> `missing`. All four roots `none` also means stop: nothing installed, nothing to report.

Bind `$BC`, `$BT`, `$BD` and their versions from the output. `DOTCLAUDE=no` is a legitimate answer —
every row is `missing`, print the table anyway. `VERSION=unknown` on a plugin that IS installed means
no comparison is possible for its rows: report `installed (plugin version unresolved)` and say why.

## Phase 1 — Probe artifacts

One generic block, fed from the roster. Paste the anchor + secondary paths of the rows in scope
(after the `$ARGUMENTS` filter) into the heredoc — relative to the project root, one per line, a
trailing `/` for a directory, globs allowed.

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool:

```bash
cd "$PWD" || exit 1
while IFS= read -r rel; do
  [ -z "$rel" ] && continue
  case "$rel" in
    */)    [ -d "$rel" ] && echo "DIR  $rel" || echo "MISS $rel" ;;
    *"*"*) n=$({ find . -path "./$rel" 2>/dev/null || true; } | wc -l | tr -d ' '); n=${n:-0}; [ "$n" -gt 0 ] && echo "GLOB $rel ($n)" || echo "MISS $rel" ;;
    *)     if [ -f "$rel" ]; then echo "FILE $rel"
           elif [ -f "$rel.disabled" ]; then echo "PARK $rel.disabled"
           else echo "MISS $rel"; fi ;;
  esac
done <<'PATHS'
.claude/teams/*/team.md
.claude/teams/*/trace-ops.sh
.claude/rules/semble-first.md
PATHS
echo "OK"
```

`PARK` is **present**, not missing. Five setups `disable` by renaming their entry file to
`<name>.disabled` (Phase 1b), and the body stays byte-identical — so a `PARK` line never feeds
Phase 3's `missing` or `partial` rules, and the file it names is still a readable version stamp.

Then the `settings.json` wiring greps — textual counts only, they do not prove the entries are
well-formed or attached to the right event:

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool:

```bash
for f in .claude/settings.json .claude/settings.local.json; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || { echo "$f absent"; continue; }
  for k in think-short agent-deadline agent-return agent-router hardmode-guard docsync; do
    echo "$f $k=$({ grep -c "$k" "$f" 2>/dev/null || true; } | tr -d ' ')"
  done
done
echo "OK"
```

Global-scope twins for rows 5, 6 and 11 (`think-short-setup`, `agent-deadline-setup` and
`agent-return-setup` install to project **or** `~/.claude`) — read-only, never written:

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool:

```bash
for f in "$HOME/.claude/hooks/think-short-session.mjs" "$HOME/.claude/hooks/agent-deadline-guard.mjs" "$HOME/.claude/agent-deadline.json" \
         "$HOME/.claude/hooks/agent-return-guard.mjs" "$HOME/.claude/hooks/agent-return-contract.mjs" "$HOME/.claude/hooks/agent-return-budget.mjs" "$HOME/.claude/agent-return.json"; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && echo "FILE $f" || echo "MISS $f"
done
echo "OK"
```

### Phase 1b — Disable switches

`disable` is a canonical verb on **all eleven** setups, and a deliberately disabled setup is neither
broken nor stale. Every row therefore leaves a probeable off-switch, in one of two mechanisms:

| Mechanism | What `disable` does | Why it is probeable |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **live config flag** | flips one key in the setup's own JSON; every file stays on disk, byte-identical | the reader (a hook, or the guard) re-reads the key on every invocation, so the flag IS the state |
| **entry-file parking** | renames the ONE filename discovery keys on to `<name>.disabled`; the body is byte-identical and nothing is deleted | Claude Code discovers a project agent only as `.claude/agents/<n>.md`, a project skill only as `<dir>/SKILL.md`, and auto-loads a rule only as `.claude/rules/*.md` — withholding that exact filename is the whole switch |

| Row | Setup | Mechanism | Off-switch | Disabled when |
|-----|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | teams | parking | `.claude/agents/<member>.md.disabled` | every roster member named in `team.md`'s `## Agents` table is parked. **`intent-guard` is NEVER parked** (`scripts/toggle-team.sh`: it is shared with `superreview-setup`) — exclude it before deciding. `disable` also flips each member's `Status` cell to `disabled`, but the FILENAME is the authority: the cell is a hand `Edit` step and can lag. `team.md`, `trace.jsonl`, `trace-archive.jsonl` and the cursor are untouched, so the anchor stays present |
| 2 | semble | config flag | `.claude/semble/state.json` | `.enabled` is `false` (phase `disabled`); every file stays in place |
| 3 | superreview | parking | `.claude/skills/superreview/SKILL.md.disabled` | present and `SKILL.md` absent. `references/` and `.template-baseline/` stay live and readable — that is the point of parking `SKILL.md` and not the directory |
| 4 | task-board | parking | any of the FOUR: `.claude/agents/task-tracker.md`, `.claude/skills/task-board/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/task-spec/SKILL.md`, `.claude/rules/tasks.md` — each as `<name>.disabled` | every DEPLOYED one of the four is parked. `.claude/features/**` is untouched, so the anchor `board.md` stays present. `task-spec` legitimately never existed on a board installed with `SPEC_MODE=off` — absent is not parked |
| 5 | think-short | parking | `.claude/hooks/think-short-prompt.md.disabled` (or the `~/.claude` twin) | present and `think-short-prompt.md` absent — the hooks stay wired and no-op |
| 6 | agent-deadline | config flag | `.claude/agent-deadline.json` (or the `~/.claude` twin) | `"enabled": false` **or the key absent**. The guard reads `if (!cfg \|\| cfg.enabled !== true) return;` (`agent-deadline-guard.mjs:354`), so an unparsable, absent or key-less config is INERT — nothing is ever enforced. This is the INVERSE of rows 7 and 10; see the note below the table |
| 7 | agent-router | config flag | `.claude/brewtools/agent-router.json` | `"enabled": false`. **An absent key means ENABLED** — `agent-router.mjs:118` defaults `enabled: true` and `:259` only ever flips it on a literal `raw.enabled === false`, so `:571` (`cfg.enabled === false` -> return) never fires on a key-less config |
| 8 | manager wall | config flag | `.claude/brewtools/manager/state.json` | `.hard` is not `true` — registration stays, the guard no-ops. This is the disarmed wall, not a broken one |
| 9 | memory-sync | parking | `.claude/skills/memory-sync/SKILL.md.disabled` | present and `SKILL.md` absent. The 3 `references/` and every SELF-SYNC hand-edit stay byte-identical |
| 10 | docsync | config flag | `.claude/docsync/config.json` | `"enabled": false`. **An ABSENT `enabled` key means ENABLED** — all three hooks read `c.enabled !== false` (`docsync-track.mjs:72`, `docsync-watch.mjs:69`, `docsync-gate.mjs:78`), so back-compat installs written before the key existed are live. Never read a missing key as off |
| 11 | agent-return | config flag | `.claude/agent-return.json` (or the `~/.claude` twin) | `"enabled": false` **or the key absent**. The shared module gates on `CONFIG.enabled === true` (`agent-return-budget.mjs:111`), so an unparsable, absent or key-less config is INERT — the contract is never injected and the return is never sized. Same polarity as row 6, the INVERSE of rows 7 and 10. Project config wins; a MALFORMED project config is skipped and the GLOBAL one takes over, so read both scopes before deciding |

> **An absent `enabled` key does NOT mean the same thing on every row — read the writer, never the
> key name.** Two opposite defaults ship side by side, and conflating them inverts a whole row:
>
> | Row | Reader's test | Absent key means | Consequence for this skill |
> |-----|---------------|------------------|----------------------------|
> | 6 agent-deadline | `cfg.enabled !== true` -> return (`agent-deadline-guard.mjs:354`) | **INERT** | a key-less config is `disabled`, never `installed` — reporting it live claims a deadline is enforced when none is |
> | 7 agent-router | default `enabled: true`, flipped only on `raw.enabled === false` (`agent-router.mjs:118`, `:259`, `:571`) | **ENABLED** | a key-less config is live; reporting it off would tell the user to `enable` an already-armed hook |
> | 10 docsync | `c.enabled !== false` in all three hooks (`docsync-track.mjs:72`, `docsync-watch.mjs:69`, `docsync-gate.mjs:78`) | **ENABLED** | same as row 7 — back-compat installs predating the key are live |
> | 11 agent-return | `CONFIG.enabled === true` -> on, anything else off (`agent-return-budget.mjs:111`) | **INERT** | same as row 6 — a key-less config is `disabled`, and reporting it live claims a return budget that is never applied |
>
> Rows 7 and 10 are opt-out, rows 6 and 11 are opt-in. The probe below therefore emits a THIRD token,
> `no-key`, instead of guessing — and Phase 3 rule 2 maps it per row, not globally.

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool — config flags. Every arm prints a line: a row that produces no output at
all is indistinguishable from a row the block forgot, so `ABSENT` is stated, never implied:

```bash
for d in "$PWD/.claude" "$HOME/.claude"; do
  j="$d/agent-deadline.json"
  if [ -f "$j" ]; then
    e=$({ tr -d ' \n' < "$j" | grep -o '"enabled":[a-z]*' || true; } | head -1)
    echo "agent-deadline $j: ${e:-no-key} (absent/no-key = INERT)"
  else echo "agent-deadline ABSENT $j"; fi
  r="$d/agent-return.json"
  if [ -f "$r" ]; then
    e=$({ tr -d ' \n' < "$r" | grep -o '"enabled":[a-z]*' || true; } | head -1)
    echo "agent-return $r: ${e:-no-key} (absent/no-key = INERT)"
  else echo "agent-return ABSENT $r"; fi
done
for f in .claude/semble/state.json .claude/brewtools/agent-router.json .claude/brewtools/manager/state.json; do
  if [ -f "$f" ]; then
    echo "$f: $({ tr -d ' \n' < "$f" | grep -o '"\(enabled\|hard\|phase\)":[^,}]*' || true; } | tr '\n' ' ')"
  else echo "$f absent"; fi
done
c=.claude/docsync/config.json
if [ -f "$c" ]; then
  case "$(tr -d ' \n' < "$c")" in
    *'"enabled":false'*) echo "docsync PARKED $c (enabled:false)" ;;
    *)                   echo "docsync LIVE   $c (enabled:true or key absent — absent means enabled)" ;;
  esac
else echo "docsync ABSENT $c"; fi
echo "OK"
```

| Rows 6 and 11 output | Reading |
|----------------------|---------|
| `"enabled":true` | live — fall through to the rest of Phase 3 |
| `"enabled":false` | `disabled` |
| `no-key` | `disabled` — the guard returns before doing anything. Say *config carries no `enabled` key, the guard treats that as off* in *found*; the fix is `enable`, not `upgrade` |
| `ABSENT` on both scopes while the hook files exist | `partial` — the guard is wired but has no config to read, so it can never arm |

Row 7's `agent-router.json` and row 10's `config.json` take the opposite default: no `enabled` token in
the output line is `ENABLED`, and neither ever yields `disabled` on a missing key.

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool — entry-file parking. **Row 5 (think-short) parks; it belongs here, not in
the config-flag block above.** `LIVE` / `PARKED` / `ABSENT` are three distinct answers and the block
never collapses them: `ABSENT` means never deployed, `PARKED` means deployed and switched off:

```bash
for f in .claude/skills/superreview/SKILL.md .claude/skills/memory-sync/SKILL.md \
         .claude/agents/task-tracker.md .claude/skills/task-board/SKILL.md \
         .claude/skills/task-spec/SKILL.md .claude/rules/tasks.md; do
  if   [ -f "$f" ];          then echo "LIVE   $f"
  elif [ -f "$f.disabled" ]; then echo "PARKED $f.disabled"
  else                            echo "ABSENT $f"; fi
done
for d in "$PWD/.claude" "$HOME/.claude"; do
  p="$d/hooks/think-short-prompt.md"
  if   [ -f "$p" ];           then echo "LIVE   $p"
  elif [ -f "$p.disabled" ];  then echo "PARKED $p.disabled"
  else                             echo "ABSENT $p"; fi
done
for t in .claude/teams/*/team.md; do
  [ -f "$t" ] || continue
  n=$(basename "$(dirname "$t")")
  awk '/^## Agents/{a=1;next} a&&/^## /{exit} a&&/^\|/{split($0,c,"|");gsub(/[`[:space:]]/,"",c[2]);if(c[2]!=""&&c[2]!~/^-+$/&&c[2]!="Agent")print c[2]}' "$t" |
  while IFS= read -r m; do
    [ "$m" = "intent-guard" ] && continue
    l=0; p=0
    [ -f ".claude/agents/$m.md" ] && l=1
    [ -f ".claude/agents/$m.md.disabled" ] && p=1
    if   [ "$l$p" = "11" ]; then echo "CONFLICT team:$n $m"
    elif [ "$l" = 1 ];      then echo "LIVE   team:$n $m"
    elif [ "$p" = 1 ];      then echo "PARKED team:$n $m"
    else                         echo "ABSENT team:$n $m"; fi
  done
done
echo "OK"
```

Row 5 prints one line per scope, and only the scope whose `think-short-session.mjs` Phase 1 found is
the answer — `ABSENT` on the other scope is not a finding. `ABSENT` on the *installed* scope while its
four hooks are wired is `partial`, not `disabled`: the hooks fire and inject nothing, which is a
broken install, and the whole reason this row cannot be probed by presence of the hooks alone.

Reading the two multi-artifact rows (1 and 4), where a toggle can land halfway:

| Pattern | Row state |
|---------|-----------|
| every deployed artifact `PARKED` | `disabled` — the intended state |
| every deployed artifact `LIVE` | not disabled; fall through to the rest of Phase 3 |
| some `LIVE`, some `PARKED` | `partial` — a `disable`/`enable` that did not finish. Name the halves; the fix is re-running the same verb, which is a documented no-op on the artifacts already in the requested state |
| `ABSENT` on row 4's `task-spec` alone, everything else `LIVE` | not a disable signal at all — that is the roster's `SPEC_MODE=off` / pre-spec-layer absence signal, already handled as `stale` |
| any `CONFLICT team:<t> <agent>` | `partial`, and it outranks every other teams reading. Both `.md` and `.md.disabled` exist for that member: `teams-setup enable` REFUSES the whole team (`CONFLICT:` line, nothing moved) and `verify-team.sh` FAILS. Name each member; the fix is manual — keep the copy you want, delete or rename the other, then re-run `/brewcode:teams-setup <team> enable` |

### Phase 1c — Environment prerequisites

One prerequisite, not a roster row: the **task-graph tools**. Claude Code 2.1.233 stopped shipping
`TaskCreate` / `TaskGet` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList` and `TodoWrite` on Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5, Fable 5,
Mythos 5 and newer, behind `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1`
([tools reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#task-tool-availability),
[env vars](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars)). Every manager-framework instruction that says
*build the task graph first* is unexecutable while the key is unset, and nothing announces that —
the tools are simply absent. Probe it in three steps, in this order.

**a. Claude Code version.** `claude --version` prints `2.1.233 (Claude Code)`. Compare the three
components as INTEGERS — a string compare puts `2.1.99` above `2.1.233` and inverts the whole
answer. Below 2.1.233 the tools are on by default: print one line, `CC <ver> < 2.1.233 — task tools
on by default, check skipped`, skip steps b and c, and make no offer in Phase 4.

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e '
const cur = (process.argv[1] || "").split(".").map(n => parseInt(n, 10) || 0);
const need = [2, 1, 233];
let cmp = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { if ((cur[i] || 0) !== need[i]) { cmp = (cur[i] || 0) - need[i]; break; } }
console.log(cmp < 0
  ? `CC ${cur.join(".")} < 2.1.233 — task tools on by default, check skipped`
  : `CC ${cur.join(".")} >= 2.1.233 — gate applies`);
' "$(claude --version 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $1}')" && echo "✅" || echo "❌ FAILED"
```

**b. The key, in all three settings layers**, read as JSON — never grepped. `env` is a nested object
and a grep hit proves nothing about which block the token sits in. A missing file is a normal
answer, not an error, and the FIRST layer carrying the key is the one reported:

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e '
import fs from "node:fs";
import os from "node:os";
import path from "node:path";
const layers = [
  ["global",  path.join(os.homedir(), ".claude", "settings.json")],
  ["project", path.join(process.cwd(), ".claude", "settings.json")],
  ["local",   path.join(process.cwd(), ".claude", "settings.local.json")],
];
let on = null;
for (const [name, f] of layers) {
  if (!fs.existsSync(f)) { console.log(`${name} ABSENT ${f}`); continue; }
  let j;
  try { j = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(f, "utf8")); }
  catch { console.log(`${name} UNPARSABLE ${f}`); continue; }
  const v = j && j.env ? j.env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS : undefined;
  console.log(`${name} ${v === undefined ? "no-key" : JSON.stringify(v)} ${f}`);
  if (on === null && v !== undefined && String(v) !== "0") on = name;
}
console.log(`TODO_TOOLS ${on ? `on (${on})` : "off"}`);
' && echo "✅" || echo "❌ FAILED"
```

**c. Verdict** — the block's own last line, one of two:

| Verdict | Meaning | Phase 4 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `on (<layer>)` | the key is set in that layer; the tools are available | report the layer in one line, ask NOTHING |
| `off` | no layer carries it; the tools are absent on this model | report it, then make the ONE offer |

`UNPARSABLE` on a layer is not `off` for that layer — it is a broken settings file. Say which file,
and never offer to write into it (the merge in Phase 4 refuses it too).

## Phase 2a — Read the content_version stamps (the headline)

ONE generic block for all eleven rows: it dispatches on file extension, so the roster's carrier column
is the only thing that decides which path goes in. Paste into `PLUGIN_ROOT` the `ROOT=` Phase 0
printed for the plugin whose rows you are scanning and set `PLUGIN` to that plugin's name — **run it
three times, once per plugin**, since brewcode / brewtools / brewdoc can sit at different versions.
Nothing else changes between the three runs.

**The heredoc is the complete set, enumerated — never a sample to expand.** It carries all twenty-one
carrier lines for all eleven rows on every run and filters by the `PLUGIN` tag, so a row cannot be
silently dropped by an operator who expands two exemplars and stops. Two assertions make drift LOUD
rather than silent: `TOTAL` must be 21 (a line deleted anywhere aborts, even in a plugin group this
run is not scanning) and `SEEN` must equal the group's `WANT` (3 / 15 / 3). Both are `exit 1`, not a
warning. **Adding a roster row means adding its carrier lines here — each with its plugin-side
`content_version` source in field 4 — AND raising both counts in the same edit** — that is the whole
cost, and the assertion is what charges it.

**Never type the plugin version into this block.** It is re-derived from `PLUGIN_ROOT` with the same
precedence Phase 0 used — cache-directory basename first, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `.version`
second — so the comparison can never be pinned to a number that was current when this file was
written. The authority for that precedence is `brewcode/hooks/session-start.mjs` `parseVersion`, which
matches `/\/(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\/?$/` on the root and falls back to `plugin.json`: one precedence, two
consumers.

> **`content_version` is compared PER ARTIFACT, never to the release-wide `$PLUGIN_VER`.**
> `references/artifact-metadata.md` §6 defines the comparison as *the plugin's own current
> `content_version` for that same artifact* — a byte-copied asset the plugin itself has not touched in
> three releases keeps a `content_version` three behind `$PLUGIN_VER` on BOTH sides, and comparing it
> to `$PLUGIN_VER` printed `BEHIND` on a genuinely current install, reproducing the exact
> false-staleness this field exists to fix. So every `STAMPS` line carries a FOURTH field: the
> plugin-side file that supplies (or bakes) that artifact's `content_version`, resolved under
> `$PLUGIN_ROOT` exactly like a `cmp` pair. For a byte-copied asset that is the asset itself; for a
> generated artifact it is the generator's own `SKILL.md`, whose `brewcode-meta:` marker every
> installer self-locates `{CONTENT_VERSION}` from.
>
> `$PLUGIN_VER` stays the reference in exactly three cases: the installed artifact carries no
> `content_version` at all (the headline falls back to `version`, same as before), the line names no
> source, or the source's own value is absent or placeholder-shaped. Every verdict line prints which
> basis it used — `cv-src` or `plugin-ver` — so a fallback is never silent, and a source path missing
> from the cache prints its own `SRC-MISS` line beside the verdict.

> **This is NOT the §4 idiom, and citing §4 here would be wrong.** `references/artifact-metadata.md`
> §4 rank 3 calls the cache glob *"forbidden as the primary path"* — and it is right, **for a
> writer**. A generator that stamps an artifact must record the version it is RUNNING AS, which under
> `claude --plugin-dir ./brewcode` is the checkout, not the cache; resolving from the cache there
> bakes a number the run never used. This skill writes nothing and stamps nothing. Its question is the
> opposite one — *which installed plugin is the artifact on disk being compared against* — and the
> installed plugin IS the cache leaf that Phase 0 already resolved and printed. Re-deriving it from
> `PLUGIN_ROOT`'s basename is reading back the answer, not guessing at one; the `plugin.json` fallback
> covers a root that is not a version-named leaf. §4's own guard against "picks a stale leaf when
> several versions are cached" is discharged by Phase 0's `sort -V | tail -1`, and the `--plugin-dir`
> hazard is discharged by the Guards table, which STOPs when no cache root exists rather than
> substituting the checkout.

```

Each heredoc line is `plugin|path|expected-owner|content_version-source`. The owner is the row's own
`<plugin>:<skill>` — the roster's Skill column with the leading `/` dropped — so it needs no new
roster column and cannot drift from it. The source is `$PLUGIN_ROOT`-relative and is read with the
same carrier dispatch as the artifact: for a byte-copied asset it IS the asset (`assets/<same
name>`), for a generated artifact it is the generator's `SKILL.md`, whose line-10 `brewcode-meta:`
marker every installer self-locates `{CONTENT_VERSION}` from. Leave a field empty to skip that check
— no owner, or no per-artifact comparison (then `$PLUGIN_VER` is the reference).

How the twenty-one lines map onto the eleven rows — the mapping the two assertions enforce:

| Rows | Lines | Carriers |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1, 2, 3 (`PLUGIN=brewcode`, `WANT=3`) | 3 | `team.md` (glob, see below), `semble-first.md`, the EMITTED `superreview/SKILL.md` |
| 4 (`PLUGIN=brewtools`, `WANT=15`) | 1 | `board.md` |
| 5 | 2 | `think-short-session.mjs` in BOTH scopes |
| 6 | 4 | `agent-deadline-guard.mjs` + `agent-deadline.json`, in BOTH scopes |
| 7 | 2 | `agent-router.mjs` + `agent-router.json` (project-only setup, one scope) |
| 8 | 2 | `state.json` (primary) + the copied `hardmode-guard.mjs` (documented fallback) |
| 11 | 4 | `agent-return-guard.mjs` + `agent-return.json`, in BOTH scopes |
| 9, 10 (`PLUGIN=brewdoc`, `WANT=3`) | 3 | the emitted `memory-sync/SKILL.md`, `docsync/config.json`, `docsync-track.mjs` |

Three things the enumeration made the block responsible for, rather than the operator:

- **Row 1's glob is expanded by the block**, one verdict per team, so a repo with several teams at
  several versions prints them all. A glob that matches nothing prints one `MISSING` for the pattern.
  Never hand-resolve it — hand-resolution is how a second team goes unread.
- **`~/` is expanded against `$HOME`** so the global-scope twins of rows 5, 6 and 11 are real paths. Both
  scopes are always scanned and **`MISSING` on the scope that is not installed is not a finding** —
  the same rule Phase 1b states for row 5. Only the scope Phase 1 found is the answer.
- **Rows 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11 print two lines each per installed scope, and the roster's precedence
  decides which is the headline** — the JSON first on 6, 7, 10 and 11; on row 8 the `state.json` first and the guard's
  `brewcode-meta` line only when `state.json` carries no `version` key. The second line is never a
  contradiction to reconcile; it is the fallback answering.

> **Row 8 can print `LEGACY-NONE` on a perfectly current install, and that is the documented path,
> not a legacy finding.** `writeState` OMITS `version` when it cannot resolve the plugin version
> rather than stamping `unknown` (`brewtools/hooks/lib/manager-state.mjs:242-252`) — see
> `references/artifact-metadata.md`, "A writer that cannot resolve the version ABORTS". An absent key
> is exactly the `missing` signal the roster's row 8 defines, so read the guard's line beneath it and
> report from that. `LEGACY-NONE` on `state.json` **with** a `CURRENT` guard line is `installed`, not
> `stale (legacy, unstamped)`.

The reference each verdict was measured against is printed in the same line: `cv-src` = the plugin's
own `content_version` for that artifact, `plugin-ver` = the `$PLUGIN_VER` fallback.

| Verdict | Means | Feeds Phase 3 as |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| `CURRENT` | headline stamp == the reference (`cv-src`, or `$PLUGIN_VER` on the fallback) | `installed` (if the row's `cmp` pairs agree) |
| `BEHIND` | headline stamp < the reference | `stale (X.Y.Z -> A.B.C)` |
| `AHEAD` | headline stamp > the reference | `stale` — a dev/`--plugin-dir` install newer than the cache; say so, do not tell the user to upgrade the project |
| `SRC-MISS` | the line's `content_version` source is absent from the cache, so the reference the artifact would be measured against does not exist. It is the ONLY line printed for that artifact — no version verdict follows it, because there is nothing to compare to. Applies only to an artifact that itself carries a `content_version`; a `version`-only artifact is measured against `$PLUGIN_VER` as usual | `unknown` — say the cache is incomplete for that asset, exactly as `NOSRC` does in Phase 2b. **Never `stale`**: falling back to `$PLUGIN_VER` here is what reported a byte-current artifact as `BEHIND` |
| `LEGACY-FMT` | no headline stamp (neither `content_version` nor `version`), but a **retired** spelling is present (`memory-sync template vX.Y.Z`, `intent-guard template v2`, `SKILL METADATA - generated <ts>`, `<!-- last-updated: -->`, `updatedAt` / `lastUpdated` / `checkedAt` …) | `stale (legacy stamp)` — the migration case, one `upgrade` restamps it |
| `LEGACY-NONE` | file exists and carries neither `content_version` nor `version` in any carrier, and no retired spelling | `stale (legacy, unstamped)` |
| `PLACEHLD` | the headline stamp is still an unresolved token — `{...}` (sanctioned `{PLUGIN_VERSION}`/`{CONTENT_VERSION}` or retired `{{PLUGIN_VERSION}}`) or a retired angle form (`<plugin X.Y.Z>`, `<date +%F>`, `<YYYY-MM-DD>`) | `partial` — substitution never finished. On row 3 this is only ever read from the EMITTED file, never from `.template-baseline/` |
| `MISSING` | no such file **and no `.disabled` twin** | the row's anchor decides: `missing` or `partial` |

The owner check prints an EXTRA line beside the version verdict, never instead of it — a file can be
`CURRENT` and owner-wrong at once, and that pair is the whole point:

| Verdict | Means | Feeds Phase 3 as |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| `OWNER-WRONG` | `generated_by` names a different skill than the row that owns the artifact | `partial` — some other generator wrote this path. Name both skills; the fix is re-running the OWNING setup, and the user must be told the other one may overwrite it again |
| `OWNER-NONE` | the headline stamp is present but `generated_by` is not | `stale (legacy stamp)` — a pre-standard or partial stamp. `references/artifact-metadata.md` §1 requires the field in every artifact and every carrier, so its absence beside a real `content_version`/`version` is an incomplete write, not a variant |
| (no line) | `generated_by` equals the expected owner | nothing — silence is the pass |

**Why `generated_by` gets a reader and `last_updated`/`doc_type` do not.** Five fields are written; the
question for each is whether a reader can turn it into an ACTIONABLE verdict:

| Field | Read here? | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| `content_version` | yes — the headline | the last release that actually changed THIS artifact's content; it maps to five of the six states, and it is preferred over `version` on every row wired for it |
| `version` | yes — provenance, and the fallback headline | the plugin release that produced this install. Read and displayed on every row, but it drives the verdict only on an artifact that carries no `content_version` at all — a pre-5.6 install, since all eleven rows are wired today — and then against `$PLUGIN_VER`, since a per-artifact comparison has nothing to compare. `version` bumps on every release regardless of whether THIS artifact changed, which is the false-staleness `content_version` exists to fix |
| `generated_by` | yes | it is the ONE field whose wrong value is otherwise undetectable. Two setups can write the same path (`intent-guard.md` is emitted by both `superreview-setup` and `teams-setup`), a hand-copied artifact carries its source's owner, and a template pasted between skills carries the wrong one forever — none of which any other signal sees, because the version and the bytes can both be perfectly right. The action is concrete: re-run the owning setup |
| `last_updated` | **no** | it is a date, and no state in this skill's vocabulary is defined by one. It cannot disagree with the headline in any way the headline does not already report: a stale date on a current stamp means only that the release did not change the file, and an old date on an old stamp is the `BEHIND` the row already prints. Reading it would emit a verdict whose only fix is the `upgrade` already prescribed — noise on every row. It is also absent by design from every `.mjs`/`.sh` stamp and from `semble-first.md` (§1), so a reader would have to special-case half the roster to say nothing new. Never infer staleness from it, exactly as this skill never infers it from an mtime |
| `doc_type` | **no** | it is docsync's field and it is USER-OWNED: §1 says a repo that chose `user` or `skip` chose deliberately, and `semble-guidance.sh` preserves the destination's value even under `--force`. A value that differs from the template is the spec working, so there is no mismatch to report |

**The `.disabled` fallback is what keeps a disabled install from reading as an unstamped one.** A
parked entry file (Phase 1b) is byte-identical to the live one, stamp included, so the block retries
`$f.disabled` before giving up and dispatches the carrier on the name with `.disabled` stripped. The
printed path keeps the suffix, so the row's version is real and its parked state is visible in the
same line. Without this a `disable` would turn every affected row into `MISSING` -> `missing`, i.e.
"never installed" — the exact misreading a reversible off-switch must not produce.

The carriers the block understands are exactly the ones in `references/artifact-metadata.md` §2, and
`version` and `generated_by` are read out of the SAME carrier on every branch — never one from the
frontmatter and the other from a comment:

| Carrier | `content_version` | `version` | `generated_by` |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|----------------|
| `.json` | top-level `"content_version"` key | top-level `"version"` key | top-level `"generated_by"` key |
| `.mjs` / `.sh` | `content_version=` in the same `brewcode-meta:` comment right after the shebang (only the first 5 lines are scanned) | `version=` right beside it | `generated_by=` in that same one line — all three are pulled from the single `brewcode-meta:` match, so a second marker deeper in the file cannot supply part of a stamp |
| anything else | frontmatter `content_version:` in the first 40 lines, then a `\| Content Version \| X.Y.Z \|` header-table row, then a `brewcode-meta:` marker anywhere in that same 40-line head | frontmatter `version:`, then a `\| Version \| X.Y.Z \|` header-table row, then that marker | frontmatter `generated_by:`, then a `\| Generated by \| … \|` header-table row, then `generated_by=` in that marker |

The `brewcode-meta:` fallback on the third row exists because `think-short-prompt.md` and the three
`memory-sync` references carry their stamp as an HTML comment — those bodies are injected into a
prompt or cited verbatim, so frontmatter would leak into the text. It scans the whole 40-line head
rather than the first 5 because the `content_version` SOURCES of the generated rows are plugin
`SKILL.md` files, whose marker sits at line 10, under nine lines of frontmatter. The `generated_by=` extraction
strips a trailing `-->` for exactly that reason: in `<!-- brewcode-meta: version=X.Y.Z generated_by=brewdoc:memory-sync-setup -->`
the owner is the last token before the comment close.

Values are quoted in YAML and JSON (`version: "X.Y.Z"`, `content_version: "X.Y.Z"`, `generated_by:
"brewcode:teams-setup"`) and bare in the header table (`| Version | X.Y.Z |`, `| Content Version |
X.Y.Z |`); the block strips quotes either way, and backticks off a header-table owner cell.

**The `PLACEHLD` test is deliberately generic — never a list of known tokens.** The sanctioned
spellings are single-brace `{PLUGIN_VERSION}` and `{CONTENT_VERSION}` (`references/artifact-metadata.md` §4), but retired
angle-bracket forms (`<plugin X.Y.Z>`, `<date +%F>`, `<YYYY-MM-DD>`) and the retired double-brace
`{{PLUGIN_VERSION}}` still reach artifacts installed by older releases. So the test matches ANY
`{`, `}`, `<` or `>` in the value. A real version is `X.Y.Z` and can hold none of them, so this
never false-positives — and an unsubstituted token can never be fed to `sort -V`, which would
otherwise turn "substitution never ran" into a confident `BEHIND`/`AHEAD`. Never hardcode how many
placeholder spellings exist; the character test outlives the list.

The `LEGACY-FMT` grep is the mirror image — it names the exact retired strings of
`references/artifact-metadata.md` §8. `SKILL METADATA` matches only when followed by `generated`
(`SKILL METADATA - generated <ts>`, dash spelling irrelevant): live skills use the bare words in
other sentences, and a bare-substring match would report a current artifact as legacy.

**And its reach is the heredoc, which carries ARTIFACTS only.** The retired spellings of §8 are
*provenance* keys, so the grep is only ever meaningful on a file whose version is a staleness
signal. `references/artifact-metadata.md` §9 puts ephemeral runtime state out of scope entirely —
epoch-ms markers, TTL caches, `.claude/semble/state.json`, `.claude/docsync/state-<session_id>.json` — and none
of those may be added to the `STAMPS` heredoc even when a row lists them as secondaries. Feeding one
in is the only way this grep can false-positive: a `checkedAt`-style key inside a runtime cache is
correct code, not a legacy stamp. `brewcode/hooks/session-start.mjs` was the tree's last such
collision and now spells its TTL marker `fetchedAtMs`, so no shipped file trips the detector today —
but the scope rule, not the rename, is what keeps that true.

> `last_updated` is deliberately ABSENT from `.mjs`/`.sh` stamps and from the byte-copied

## Phase 2b — `cmp` the byte-copied files (corroboration)

Only for rows whose roster cell names a `cmp` pair, and only when the anchor exists. Feed
`project|plugin` pairs built from the roster (absolute plugin paths from Phase 0).

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool:

```bash
while IFS='|' read -r a b; do
  [ -z "$a" ] && continue
  if   [ ! -f "$a" ]; then echo "ABSENT  $a"
  elif [ ! -f "$b" ]; then echo "NOSRC   $b"
  elif cmp -s "$a" "$b"; then echo "SAME    $a"
  else echo "DIFFERS $a"; fi
done <<'PAIRS'
.claude/hooks/semble-session.mjs|/abs/BC/skills/semble-setup/assets/semble-session.mjs
PAIRS
echo "OK"
```

`DIFFERS` on a file whose stamp reads `CURRENT` is the case the stamp alone cannot see: the copy came
from this plugin version but its bytes no longer match — a hand-edit, or an install that was never
re-run after a same-version rebuild. Report `stale (bytes drifted)` and name the file.

**Only a byte-STABLE copy belongs in `PAIRS`.** A file the install fills or appends to after copying
it — `memory-sync`'s `references/hard-sync.md` (BLOCKs filled by the generator's Phase 3) and the
repo-root `.sembleignore` (measured-candidates block appended by `install_candidates`) — differs on
every healthy project and must never be fed in; see the row-2 and row-9 carve-outs. Before adding a
pair, check the writer: if any mode writes that path after the `cp`, `cmp` answers a question nobody
asked, and the remedy the dashboard then prescribes destroys the content the installer put there.

Both violations were found by RUNNING the loop against a healthy fixture, never by reading the
roster. Re-verify a pair the same way: install into a throwaway repo and check the loop prints
`SAME` on a fresh install.

## Phase 3 — Classify

Exactly one state per row, in this order:

| # | Condition | State |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | The row's plugin has `ROOT=none` | `n/a` |
| 2 | Phase 1b shows this row's off-switch thrown — a config flag at `enabled:false`, row 6's `no-key`, `.hard != true`, or every deployed entry file `PARKED` | `disabled` |
| 3 | Anchor MISS and every secondary MISS, **in both spellings** — no `<name>.disabled` twin anywhere on the row | `missing` |
| 4 | Anchor MISS but some secondary present, or anchor present with any secondary MISS, or a row-1/row-4 toggle left half `LIVE` half `PARKED`, or the stamp reads `PLACEHLD`, or Phase 2a printed `OWNER-WRONG` | `partial` |
| 5 | Stamp reads `BEHIND` or `AHEAD` | `stale (X.Y.Z -> A.B.C)` — print both versions |
| 6 | Stamp reads `LEGACY-FMT`, or `OWNER-NONE` beside a real version | `stale (legacy stamp)` |
| 7 | Stamp reads `LEGACY-NONE` | `stale (legacy, unstamped)` |
| 8 | The roster's absence signal fires (rows 1 and 4), or row 2's wiring signal fires (`retired[]`, `staleEntries`, or `wiredCount < wantCount`) | `stale` — name the artifact that is missing, or the wiring gap |
| 9 | Stamp `CURRENT`, but any `cmp` pair `DIFFERS` | `stale (bytes drifted)` — name the file |
| 10 | Stamp `CURRENT`, every `cmp` pair `SAME` (or the row defines none) | `installed` |
| 11 | Stamp `CURRENT` but a `cmp` source is `NOSRC` | `version unknown (plugin asset missing)` — the cache is incomplete, never `stale` |

State vocabulary is unchanged — `n/a` · `missing` · `disabled` · `partial` · `stale` · `installed`.
`stale` takes one of four qualifiers when a stamp or byte signal fired — rules 5-7 and 9, matching
`references/artifact-metadata.md` §6: `(X -> Y)` a version behind or ahead, `(legacy stamp)` a
retired stamp format, `(legacy, unstamped)` no stamp at all, `(bytes drifted)` right version wrong
bytes. Rule 8's absence and wiring signals print a bare `stale` with no qualifier, naming the missing
artifact (or the wiring gap) in *found* instead. Nothing else is a state.

Rules 2 and 3 are the two that stop false alarms:

- **`disabled` is evaluated FIRST, ahead of `missing`, `partial` and `stale`.** Five setups
  `disable` by parking their entry file, so on a disabled install the anchor itself is renamed away
  and every later rule would misfire — `missing` ("never installed"), or `partial` ("repair this")
  for something the user switched off on purpose. Inversely, a semble at `enabled:false`, a manager
  wall at `hard:false` or a docsync at `enabled:false` has every file in place and must NOT be
  reported `installed`: the mechanism is inert. A `disabled` row's Command column offers `enable`,
  never `upgrade`, and it never enters the run-list.
- **A missing `enabled` key is resolved per row, from the reader, never by a house default.** Rows 6
  (agent-deadline) and 11 (agent-return) are opt-in — `cfg.enabled !== true` / `CONFIG.enabled === true`
  — so `no-key` is `disabled`. Rows 7 and 10 are opt-out, so a missing key is live and never reaches
  this rule. Applying one default to all four inverts two of them, and an inverted row 6 or 11 is the
  worst of the two directions: it reports a deadline as enforced, or a return budget as applied, when
  the guard returns on its first line.
- **Anchor MISS is decisive — but a `.disabled` twin is not a MISS.** The anchor is the artifact only
  that setup writes. No anchor in EITHER spelling = not installed, whatever else the project happens
  to contain. Never call a row `partial` on the strength of a shared file (see the exclusivity note
  in the roster), and never call a parked artifact absent.

**The verdict for a disabled install is `disabled` plus its real version.** Print the stamp Phase 2a
read out of the parked file (or out of the untouched config), not `--`: the install has a version, it
is simply not active. `disabled` is never combined with a `stale` qualifier — if a switched-off row
is also behind, say so in the *found* column and still offer `enable`, because `upgrade` on a parked
install is what the owning setups explicitly refuse (`task-board-setup` STOPs, `memory-sync`'s
`validate` FAILs, `superreview`'s `validate` FAILs — all three tell the user to `enable` first).

**Read the stamp; never guess a version.** `content_version` is the headline field on all eleven rows
and reading it — against the plugin's own value for that artifact — is the job. `version` stays real
data too, displayed as provenance and used as the fallback headline on an artifact installed before
its setup was wired for `content_version`. What stays forbidden is unchanged in spirit:
never invent a version an artifact does not carry, never infer staleness from a file's mtime, never
derive a version from a directory name inside the project, and never report a signal this roster does
not define. An artifact with no stamp is `stale (legacy stamp)` — that is a fact about the install,
not licence to estimate what produced it.

Two facts that look like staleness and are not:

- `DIFFERS` on row 8's guard means only that `manager-setup install` has not been re-run since the
  last brewtools update — the wall still works. Report `stale`, and say that in one clause. That is
  a different finding from `hard: false`, which is rule 3's `disabled` and outranks it.
- A hook copied under `~/.claude` while the project also has one is a **scope** answer, not a
  conflict. Report the scope; rows 5, 6 and 11 are legitimately global.

## Phase 4 — Output

Print the PLAN block (Prompt contract above) first, then lead with ONE line, before anything else —
how many rows are behind the installed plugin:

```
4 of 11 setups are behind the installed plugin (2 stale by content_version, 1 legacy stamp, 1 drifted bytes).
```

Count only rows whose stamp is not `CURRENT` plus `stale (bytes drifted)`. `missing`, `disabled` and
`n/a` are not "behind" — they are not installed, switched off, or not applicable. If the number is 0,
say `all 11 setups are at <the resolved plugin version>` and still print the table.

Then ONE table, rows in roster order, filtered by `$ARGUMENTS`. Answer in the language the user wrote
in (RU or EN) — translate the prose, never the paths or the commands.

| Skill | State | Content Version | Found | Command |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| `/brewcode:semble-setup` | stale (bytes drifted) | A.B.C = A.B.C | stamp current, but `semble-prefetch.mjs` DIFFERS from the A.B.C asset — the copy was hand-edited or never re-run | `/brewcode:semble-setup upgrade "re-copy the hooks, semble-prefetch.mjs drifted from the installed asset"` |
| `/brewtools:task-board-setup` | stale | X.Y.Z -> A.B.C | `board.md` + tracker present, `.claude/skills/task-spec/` absent | `/brewtools:task-board-setup upgrade "retrofit the spec + design layer onto the deployed board, keep every task id"` |
| `/brewdoc:memory-sync-setup` | stale (legacy stamp) | legacy -> A.B.C | emitted skill present, carries the retired `<!-- memory-sync template v1.0.0 -->` line and no frontmatter `version:`. For the per-file drift count: `bash "$BD/skills/memory-sync-setup/scripts/generate.sh" status` (read-only, run it yourself) | `/brewdoc:memory-sync-setup upgrade "migrate the pre-5.0 tail stamp to provenance frontmatter — its restamp step rewrites version/last_updated/surface_files in place and drops the tail line, hand-edits untouched"` |
| `/brewcode:superreview-setup` | partial | `{PLUGIN_VERSION}` | emitted `SKILL.md` still holds an unresolved placeholder — substitution never finished | `/brewcode:superreview-setup install "re-emit, the previous run left {PLUGIN_VERSION} unsubstituted"` |
| `/brewdoc:docsync-setup` | missing | -- | nothing under `.claude/docsync/` | `/brewdoc:docsync-setup install` |
| `/brewcode:teams-setup` | installed | A.B.C | `team.md` (Version A.B.C) + `trace.jsonl` + `trace-ops.sh`, all bytes match | `/brewcode:teams-setup status` |
| `/brewtools:think-short-setup` | disabled | A.B.C | 4 hooks wired, prompt renamed to `think-short-prompt.md.disabled` — switched off on purpose | `/brewtools:think-short-setup enable` |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup` | n/a | -- | brewtools not installed | `claude plugin install brewtools@claude-brewcode` |

In the sample above `A.B.C` stands for the installed plugin version and `X.Y.Z` for the artifact's
own `content_version` stamp (or `version`, when the artifact predates its setup's stamping) — the real report prints
real numbers, and no literal version is ever carried in from this file.

**Content Version column format:** `X.Y.Z` when current, `X.Y.Z -> A.B.C` when behind (stamp then plugin),
`legacy -> A.B.C` for a retired stamp format, `unstamped -> A.B.C` when there is no stamp at all, the
raw token when a placeholder survived, `--` for `missing` and `n/a`. `X.Y.Z = X.Y.Z` reads "stamp matches, the problem is elsewhere" — use it on
`stale (bytes drifted)` so the reader is not left hunting for a version difference that does not exist.
`A.B.C` here is the reference the verdict actually used — the plugin-side artifact's own
`content_version` when the roster line names a source, `$PLUGIN_VER` only on the fallbacks Phase 2a
prints as `plugin-ver`. An artifact carrying no `content_version` prints its `version` fallback
instead — same format, same meaning, just the older field.

The **Command** column is a ready-to-paste line. For `stale` and `partial` it MUST carry a concrete
fine-tune prompt naming what to refresh — the drifted file, the missing artifact, the layer that was
never retrofitted, the placeholder that never resolved. A bare `upgrade` with no prompt is not
acceptable output.

> **A remedy MUST be able to clear the verdict it follows.** `upgrade` was for a long time the mode
> nobody owned: it refreshed content and left the stamp where it was, so `status` said `stale`,
> `upgrade` said success, and the next `status` said `stale` again. Every roster row now carries a
> **Remedy check** clause naming the code that proves its `upgrade` restamps. Two consequences bind
> this column:
>
> | Never emit | Because |
> |------------|---------|
> | the mode that JUST failed, as the fix for its own failure | that is the closed loop above. If a mode cannot clear its own verdict, name the one that can, or say plainly that no mode can and the user must act by hand |
> | `upgrade` on a row whose roster cell does not carry a Remedy check | an unverified remedy is a guess. Print the finding without a command rather than a command that does nothing |
>
> Three findings in this roster genuinely have NO mode that clears them, and each must be reported
> as such instead of dressed in a command: row 9's `hard-sync.md` (`DIFFERS` is the healthy state),
> a `REF DIFFERS:` hand-edit on row 9's other two references, and a prose hand-edit of row 2's
> `semble-first.md` (skipped as `user_modified`; only `--force` overwrites, and it is not a skill
> mode). Say what the user must diff and port by hand.
>
> `.sembleignore` is NOT a fourth: it is carved out of the `cmp` set, so this dashboard produces no
> byte verdict for it at all. `--force` on it overwrites the user's own uncommented exclusions —
> never print it.

Use the canonical modes ONLY: `status` · `install` · `upgrade` · `enable` · `disable` · `uninstall` ·
`purge`. The retired verbs (`create`, `update`, `cleanup`, `init`, `on`, `off`, `setup`, `remove`,
`reset`) were removed — `teams-setup` in particular now parses anything unknown as a TEAM NAME, so
emitting `/brewcode:teams-setup cleanup "..."` would install a team called `cleanup`. Never print one.

Two setups add extra verbs AFTER the canonical set, and those are live: `semble-setup` has
`reindex | optimize | resume`, `agent-router-setup` and `manager-setup` take `level <...>`. Use an
extra verb only when the roster row's finding is exactly what it fixes; otherwise the canonical verb
plus a free-text prompt.

### The run-list — grouped by real dependency, not just tier

A flat `partial -> stale -> missing` list hides one real dependency this suite has: several rows
**consume** what `teams-setup` creates (agent names for routing/`byAgentType`, or the shared
`intent-guard` it emits) or run faster once `semble-setup`'s code index exists, since every setup
below fans out subagents that read this repo. Group the run-list into these SIX stages, fixed
order; a row not in scope (`n/a`, `installed`, `disabled`, or filtered out by `$ARGUMENTS`) is
skipped, never renumbered, and a stage with zero rows in scope prints no header at all:

| Stage | Rows (roster #) | Why this stage, in one clause |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 🔧 Fix global drift | 5 think-short, 11 agent-return | global-scope — a stale install here taxes EVERY session and EVERY subagent spawn in every stage below. Cheapest fix, biggest leverage |
| 2 🔍 Search foundation | 2 semble-setup | every stage below fans out subagents that read this repo; they read it faster and more accurately with the index already built |
| 3 👥 Agent root | 1 teams-setup | creates the project's own agents plus the shared `intent-guard`; stage 4's rows reference them by name and install into a vacuum without this |
| 4 🔗 Agent consumers | 7 agent-router, 8 manager, 6 agent-deadline, 3 superreview | router dispatches `Task` calls to real agent names; deadline's `byAgentType` needs those names; manager's delegate-to-specialist model assumes agents already exist; superreview reuses `intent-guard` instead of re-emitting it |
| 5 📋 Process layer | 4 task-board-setup | its board and `task-tracker` agent are what `manager-setup`'s hard wall and the TSK-graph instructions point at |
| 6 📚 Docs last | 9 memory-sync, then 10 docsync | memory-sync snapshots the FINISHED config — run in stage 1 it would freeze an empty project as the baseline; docsync then tracks drift against docs that already exist |

Within a stage, keep the existing tier order — `partial` (broken install) before `stale` before
`missing`. `disabled`, `installed` and `n/a` rows never appear in the run-list — a switched-off
mechanism is a choice, not a defect. Mention a `disabled` row once, below the list, tagged with the
stage it would occupy if re-enabled, alongside its `enable` command.

**The closing paragraph is not optional** — it is the one place the user sees why this dashboard
hands back commands instead of running them. Print it every time, even when the list has one entry.
Number rows CONTINUOUSLY across stages (1, 2, 3, … — never restart per stage), and keep every line
copy-pasteable on its own:

```
Run in this order, ONE PER SESSION:

  🔧 Stage 1 — fix global drift first (cheap, unlocks every stage below)
    1. /brewtools:think-short-setup upgrade "..."
    2. /brewtools:agent-return-setup upgrade "..."

  🔍 Stage 2 — search foundation
    3. /brewcode:semble-setup install

  👥 Stage 3 — agent root
    4. /brewcode:teams-setup install

  🔗 Stage 4 — agent consumers (needs stage 3's agents)
    5. /brewtools:agent-router-setup install
    6. /brewtools:manager-setup install
    7. /brewtools:agent-deadline-setup install
    8. /brewcode:superreview-setup install

  📋 Stage 5 — process layer
    9. /brewtools:task-board-setup install

  📚 Stage 6 — docs last (snapshots the finished config)
    10. /brewdoc:memory-sync-setup install
    11. /brewdoc:docsync-setup install

⚠️  Nothing above was run for you, by design. Each of these is an interactive generator: it
    fans out several subagents, analyses the repo and asks you real questions. Two in one
    session degrade each other — the context fills with the first one's analysis and the
    second one's questions get answered against stale findings. Start a fresh session per
    command, one row at a time.
```

The sample above lists all eleven for illustration only — a real run prints ONLY the rows this
report found out of scope (not `installed`/`disabled`/`n/a`), so most runs show 2–5 stages, several
skipped entirely. A single out-of-scope row still gets the full closing paragraph, just a one-line
list under its own stage header.

### The one offer — task-graph tools

Below the run-list, print Phase 1c's verdict as one line, always:

```
Task tools: on (global ~/.claude/settings.json)      <- verdict `on`
Task tools: OFF — TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList/TaskGet and TodoWrite are not available on this
            model. CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS is unset in all three settings layers.
```

Then, **and only when the verdict is `off` AND Phase 1c said the gate applies**, ask exactly ONE
`AskUserQuestion` — header `Task tools`, three options in this order:

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `Global (~/.claude) (Recommended)` | writes `~/.claude/settings.json` — every project on this machine |
| `This project only` | writes `<ROOT>/.claude/settings.json` — this repo only |
| `Leave off` | report only, change nothing |

Never ask when the verdict is `on`, never ask when Phase 1c skipped the check on an older Claude
Code, and never ask twice in one run. `Leave off` ends it: print the manual line and stop.

On `Global` or `This project only`, run the merge — **`node` via Bash, never `Write`/`Edit`.**
`~/.claude/**` is a sensitive path for the editing tools (`.claude/rules/avoid.md` #6) and a
subprocess is the sanctioned route; it also read-merges instead of overwriting, which no whole-file
write does. Pass `global` or `project` as the single argument:

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e '
import fs from "node:fs";
import os from "node:os";
import path from "node:path";
const scope = process.argv[1];
const file = scope === "global"
  ? path.join(os.homedir(), ".claude", "settings.json")
  : path.join(process.cwd(), ".claude", "settings.json");
fs.mkdirSync(path.dirname(file), { recursive: true });
let cfg = {};
if (fs.existsSync(file)) {
  try { cfg = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file, "utf8")) || {}; }
  catch { console.error(`REFUSED ${file} is not valid JSON — fix it by hand`); process.exit(1); }
}
cfg.env = { ...(cfg.env || {}), CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS: "1" };
const tmp = `${file}.tmp-${process.pid}`;
fs.writeFileSync(tmp, JSON.stringify(cfg, null, 2) + "\n");
fs.renameSync(tmp, file);
console.log(`WROTE ${file} env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1`);
' global && echo "✅" || echo "❌ FAILED"
```

Every other key in the file survives — the merge parses, adds one key under `env`, and renames a
temp file over the original, so a crash mid-write leaves the old file intact. An unparsable
settings file is REFUSED, never rewritten: say so and hand the path back.

Then report, in two lines and no more:

```
Task tools: enabled — env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1 in <the file that was written>.
Takes effect in new sessions, and usually in this one — the tool roster is re-read per request.
```

If the user picked `Leave off`, print the manual route instead and move on:
`add "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS": "1" } to ~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Phase 5 — Roster self-check

The self-updating property, as a WARNING. It never writes.

**EXECUTE** using Bash tool:

```bash
for p in brewcode brewdoc brewtools brewui; do
  r=$({ ls -d "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-brewcode/$p"/*/ 2>/dev/null || true; } | sort -V | tail -1 | sed 's:/*$::')
  [ -n "$r" ] || continue
  { find "$r/skills" -maxdepth 1 -type d -name '*-setup' 2>/dev/null || true; } | sed "s|.*/|$p:|"
done
echo "OK"
```

Compare that list against the roster's 11 commands. **Phase 1c is not a twelfth row and is never
counted here** — `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS` is an environment prerequisite, not a setup skill:
it has no `*-setup` dir on disk, no artifact, no version stamp and no canonical modes. The count
below stays 11 whatever Phase 1c reported.

| Finding | Report |
|---------|--------|
| A `*-setup` skill on disk that the roster does not know | `WARNING: <plugin>:<name> is installed but not in this skill's roster — its state was NOT checked. Add a row to setup-status/SKILL.md.` |
| A roster row whose skill dir is gone from an installed plugin | `WARNING: <row> is in the roster but no longer ships in <plugin> <version> — the row may be obsolete.` |
| Match | one line: `roster: 11/11 in sync` |

Print warnings **above** the table so they are not lost under it. Never edit the roster to fix a
warning — that is the user's call, in this repo, in a separate change.

## Guards

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User asks this skill to run a setup, "install everything", "fix them all" | Refuse once, plainly: setups are interactive multi-agent generators and batching them degrades every one. Print the run-list. Do not offer a compromise mode. |
| User asks for a `--fix` / auto flag | Same answer. It does not exist by design, not by omission. |
| All four plugin roots `none` | Report "no brewcode plugins installed" + `claude plugin install <p>@claude-brewcode`. Do not print an all-`missing` table. |
| Running with `--plugin-dir` (dev mode, no cache dir) | Phase 0 finds no root. Say so: the report needs the installed cache to compare against; the repo checkout is not a substitute. |
| Project has no `.claude/` | Every row `missing`. Print the table and the install run-list. |
| A `cmp` source path is `NOSRC` | The plugin cache is incomplete for that asset. Report `version unknown (plugin asset missing)` and say the byte check could not run — never `stale` on a missing source. |
| An artifact's stamp is `AHEAD` of the plugin | A dev checkout or `--plugin-dir` install newer than the cache. Report it as `stale` with the direction spelled out; do NOT tell the user to upgrade the project, tell them the cache is behind. |
| A mechanism-`a` asset has `content_version`/`version` but no `last_updated` | Correct by design — a date would churn the file every release and break `cmp`. Not a legacy stamp, not a finding. |
| `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` has no stamp (row 4) | Deliberate: its frontmatter is copied into every task card. Never report it. |
| `.claude/skills/memory-sync/references/hard-sync.md` differs from the plugin source (row 9) | **The healthy state, not a finding.** Its two BLOCK placeholders are filled per project by the generator's Phase 3 and `validate` fails while they are not. Never `cmp` it, never stamp-read it, never name it in a remedy. Its frozen stamp is likewise correct — `refresh_refs` refuses to overwrite filled content. |
| `generate.sh restamp` printed `REF DIFFERS:` for row 9's `memory-guide.md` or `agent-audit.md` | A genuine local edit; the file was left untouched on purpose. Report `stale (bytes drifted)`, say `upgrade` will not overwrite it, and tell the user to diff against `$BD/skills/memory-sync-setup/references/<name>` and port by hand. There is no mode that clears it. |
| Row 2's `semble-first.md` is `DIFFERS` | Read *found* before prescribing. A metadata-only delta is re-synced by `upgrade` with no `--force`; a real prose hand-edit is SKIPPED as `user_modified` and only `--force` overwrites it — which is not a skill mode. Say which case it is, and hand back the `diff -u` route for the second. |
| The repo-root `.sembleignore` differs from `assets/sembleignore.template` (row 2) | **The healthy state, not a finding.** `install_candidates` appends a measured-candidates block after the copy, so a correct install differs by construction. Never `cmp` it, never report `stale (bytes drifted)` for it, and above all never prescribe `--force` — that backs up and overwrites the user's own uncommented exclusions. Its `# brewcode-meta:` stamp stays readable and IS the row's signal for it. |
| A `team.md` header row is `CURRENT` but an agent row's `Version` is behind (row 1) | A mixed roster from a partial `upgrade`, which is legitimate. Report the row `installed` and name the lagging agents in *found* — do not downgrade the whole row. |
| A version or content_version appears in `.template-baseline/` | Ignore it. That dir is raw template with placeholders unresolved by design; only the emitted artifact has a version. |
| An artifact exists only as `<name>.disabled` | PARKED, never missing and never a `partial` trigger. The body is byte-identical, so read its stamp (Phase 2a retries `$f.disabled`) and report the row `disabled` at that version. |
| `.claude/docsync/config.json` carries no `enabled` key | ENABLED. All three docsync hooks read `c.enabled !== false`, so back-compat installs written before the key existed are live. A missing key is never `disabled` and never `partial`. Same for `.claude/brewtools/agent-router.json`. |
| `.claude/agent-deadline.json` carries no `enabled` key | **INERT — the opposite answer to docsync's.** `agent-deadline-guard.mjs:354` reads `cfg.enabled !== true`, so a key-less (or unparsable) config makes the guard return before touching anything. Report `disabled` and offer `enable`. Never carry docsync's default across to this row. |
| `.claude/agent-return.json` carries no `enabled` key | **INERT — same polarity as agent-deadline, the opposite of docsync.** `agent-return-budget.mjs:111` computes `ENABLED = !!CONFIG && CONFIG.enabled === true`, so an absent, key-less or unparsable config injects no contract and sizes no return. Report `disabled` and offer `enable`. A malformed PROJECT config is skipped in favour of the global one — read both scopes before calling the row off. |
| Only 1 or 2 of row 11's three `.mjs` are present | `partial`, never `stale`. ESM resolves imports before evaluating, so a missing `agent-return-budget.mjs` makes BOTH registered hooks exit 1 with a hook-error banner on every subagent spawn and return. Offer `install` for that scope. A `settings.json` entry pointing at `agent-return-budget.mjs` is a separate defect — that file is a shared module and is never registered. |
| Phase 2a printed `OWNER-WRONG` on a file that is otherwise `CURRENT` | `partial`. The right version and the right bytes prove nothing about who wrote the file. Name both skills in *found* and offer the OWNING setup's `install`; warn that the other generator may claim the path again. |
| Phase 2a printed `OWNER-NONE` beside a real content_version/version | `stale (legacy stamp)` — an incomplete stamp, not a variant. §1 requires `generated_by` in every artifact and every carrier. One `upgrade` restamps it. |
| An artifact's `last_updated` or `doc_type` differs from the plugin's | Not a finding, and not read. `last_updated` is a date and no state is defined by one; `doc_type` is user-owned and deliberately preserved across re-installs. Report neither. |
| A team has some members live and some `.md.disabled` | Half-applied toggle -> `partial`, naming both halves. `intent-guard` parked or live is NEVER part of that count — `toggle-team.sh` skips it because it is shared with `superreview-setup`. |
| `upgrade` looks like the fix for a `disabled` row that is also behind | It is not. `task-board-setup upgrade`, `memory-sync validate` and `superreview validate` all fail on a parked install by design. Offer `enable`; the version gap is a *found*-column note. |
| Two carriers on one row disagree (row 8: `state.json` vs the guard's meta line) | The roster names the precedence — `state.json` first. Report the headline from it and mention the second value once. |
| User asks "which of these should I install?" | Answer from the table only. Recommending a setup the project has no use for is noise — say when a row is legitimately skippable. |
