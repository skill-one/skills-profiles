# Reverse Engineer

Reverse-engineer an external system into two things: a **mechanically-verifiable teardown** (feature inventory + registry + specs, optionally a security audit) and a **steal-map** — what to adopt into our surfaces, what to leave behind. The teardown is the evidence; the steal-map is the decision. Separating them works because a decision row that must cite a registry entry can be re-checked by anyone, while a decision made from impressions cannot be re-checked by its own author. The original failure mode this skill exists to prevent: reading a competitor's README and "deciding" from vibes.

**Triggers:** "reverse-engineer X", "tear down Y", "what should we steal from Z", "evaluate competitor/upstream", "should we fork/adopt/build-native".

## Prompt

```text
Reverse-engineer the beads CLI (github.com/steveyegge/beads, tag v2.1.0)
in repo mode, then author steal-map.md comparing its dependency-graph
reconciler against our cli/internal/gates/ package. I own this analysis
and have authorization for the clone.
```

## It's working if

Observable in the trace, without reading the prose:

- `feature-registry.yaml` and `clone-metadata.json` land under
  `.agents/scratch/reverse-engineer/<product>/` with the resolved
  upstream commit recorded.
- Every `steal-map.md` row cites a teardown registry entry and our
  matching surface, using the full `have`/`gap`/`steal`/`park`/`reject`
  set.
- `bash skills/reverse-engineer/scripts/validate-output.sh --output-dir
  "$output_dir" --phase complete` exits 0 before handoff.
- A one-way-door adoption row is routed to Plan instead of decided
  inside `steal-map.md`.

## ⚠️ Constraints — Hard Guardrails (MANDATORY)

- Only operate on code/binaries you own or have **explicit written authorization** to analyze — this matters because unauthorized teardown is the legal/IP line.
- Do not provide steps to bypass protections/ToS or to extract proprietary source/system prompts.
- Do not output reconstructed proprietary source or embedded prompts (index only; redact in reports) — to prevent reproducing protected IP.
- Redact secrets/tokens/keys if encountered; run the secret-scan gate over outputs to prevent credential leakage.
- Always separate **docs say** vs **code proves** vs **hosted/control-plane**.

## Phase 1 — Mechanical teardown (the script)

Produce evidence, not vibes. The script clones (pinned), scans CLI/config/artifact surface, and writes a feature inventory + machine-checkable registry + spec set.

```bash
python3 skills/reverse-engineer/scripts/reverse_engineer.py <product> --mode=repo \
  --upstream-repo="https://github.com/org/repo.git" --upstream-ref=v1.0.0 \
  --output-dir=".agents/scratch/reverse-engineer/<product>/"
```

Binary mode requires `--authorized` (see Invocation Contract + Self-Test). Use the bundled demo fixture if you lack authorization for a real binary.

## Phase 2 — The steal-map (the decision)

Map each capability the teardown found onto **our** surfaces. This is the part that turns research into a decision. Emit `.agents/scratch/reverse-engineer/<product>/steal-map.md` with a table; every row cites the teardown evidence **and** the matching surface in our repo.

The mechanical script intentionally stops after validating Phase 1. It cannot
truthfully decide whether our live tree has, lacks, or should adopt a capability.
The caller authors `steal-map.md` from the generated registry plus a fresh read
of our repository, then runs the complete-output validator below. A missing or
malformed map is therefore an incomplete skill result, not a script success
silently relabelled as a decision.

| Their capability | Our surface today | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `<feature>` | `<our file / skill / CLI, or "none">` | **have** / **gap** / **steal** / **park** / **reject** |

Verdict rules (hard-won — apply them, do not skip):

- **steal** — we lack it and it advances our core. Steal the *pattern*, not the storage engine: re-express in our primitives, never vendor their runtime.
- **park** — real, but it's substrate we deliberately delegate (e.g. orchestration per ADR-0009) or downstream of an unproven bet. Name it, don't build it.
- **reject** — it conflicts with our doctrine (e.g. a self-reported completion edge where we require a verdict — "no verdict = not done").
- **have** — we already do this; confirm it still holds, move on.
- **gap** — we should have it and don't. These are the steal candidates.

Discipline that makes the map trustworthy:

- **Independently checked, not self-report.** Get facts on *how* they implement
  each capability from code, cross-checked by a fresh reader — never from a
  README or one context's summary. Model family is optional metadata, not a
  trust requirement.
- **Probe the real state, don't argue from stale.** Re-verify our side against the live tree before calling something a gap; every "X is missing" carries the search that proved it.
- **The steal is the pattern, not the platform.** Their robustness is usually one idea (unification, a gate, a reconcile loop). Steal the idea; leave the scaffolding.

## Route one-way-door adoptions into planning

If adopting a steal is a **one-way door** (an architecture fork, a new bounded
context, or a migration), do not decide it here. Hand the steal-map to Plan.
Dueling Idea Genies or Premortem may challenge the choice as advisory
evidence. Plan alone shapes the selected option in the existing intent source;
neither strategy grants readiness or continuation authority.

## Invocation Contract

Required: `product_name`. Common flags: `--mode=repo|binary|both`, `--upstream-repo`, `--upstream-ref` (requires the selected checkout to be at that exact commit and records its resolved SHA in `clone-metadata.json`), `--local-clone-dir` (selects that exact tree, including a non-Git tree; it never falls back to the caller's checkout), `--output-dir` (default `.agents/scratch/reverse-engineer/<product>/`), `--security-audit`, `--materialize-archives` (authorized-only opt-in; embedded-archive extraction is off/index-only by default), `--authorized` (mandatory for binary mode — refuses without it). Full list: `python3 skills/reverse-engineer/scripts/reverse_engineer.py --help`.

## Output Specification

Phase-1 teardown under `output_dir/`: `feature-inventory.md`, `feature-registry.yaml`, `feature-catalog.md`, `spec-architecture.md`, `spec-code-map.md`, `spec-clone-vs-use.md`, `spec-clone-mvp.md`, plus `spec-cli-surface.md` only when a CLI is detected. `clone-metadata.json` is written whenever an upstream repo/ref is selected and binds the exact analyzed commit, including an already-present checkout. Security mode adds `output_dir/security/`: `threat-model.md`, `attack-surface.md`, `dataflow.md`, `crypto-review.md`, `authn-authz.md`, `findings.md`, `reproducibility.md`, `validate-security-audit.sh`. Phase-2 adds the caller-authored `steal-map.md`.

- **Artifact directory:** the exact `--output-dir`, defaulting to
  `$REPO/.agents/scratch/reverse-engineer/<product>/`.
- **Filename convention:** the fixed phase-1 and phase-2 names above; security
  files live only in the `security/` child directory.
- **Serialization/schema format:** registry is YAML, clone metadata is one JSON
  object, and inventories/specs/steal-map are nonempty Markdown files.
- **Validator command:** Phase 1 runs this automatically with
  `--phase teardown`. After authoring `steal-map.md`, validate the complete
  skill output with `$output_dir`, `$security_audit`, `$sbom`, and
  `$upstream_ref_set` (each numeric flag `0|1`):

  ```bash
  bash skills/reverse-engineer/scripts/validate-output.sh \
    --output-dir "$output_dir" --phase complete \
    --security-audit "$security_audit" --sbom "$sbom" \
    --upstream-ref-set "$upstream_ref_set"
  ```
- **Downstream handoff:** give the validated `steal-map.md` to Plan for
  one-way-door candidates; ordinary `have`, `park`, and
  `reject` decisions remain evidence-backed terminal rows.

### Earlier default compatibility

Existing teardowns under `.agents/research/<product>/` remain in place and
usable. The script accepts that directory when it is passed explicitly with
`--output-dir`; that flag is caller authorization to write the teardown at the
exact selected path. It does not relocate or duplicate existing artifacts. An
invocation that omits the flag writes only to the current scratch default and
never creates output under the earlier root.
Consumers must retain the exact selected `output_dir` with their evidence
references instead of rediscovering outputs by globbing one root. This owning
skill contract is the compatibility authority; no separate migration receipt
is required.

## Reproducibility + fixtures

`--upstream-ref` binds the selected checkout to one full commit: a new clone is
checked out detached at the fetched ref, while an existing checkout must already
match or the run refuses before analysis. `clone-metadata.json` records that
resolved commit. Regression test: `bash skills/reverse-engineer/scripts/repo_fixture_test.sh`. To update a fixture when contracts legitimately change, re-run with the new pinned ref, copy the contract files into `fixtures/<product>/`, and commit.

## Self-Test (acceptance)

```bash
bash skills/reverse-engineer/scripts/self_test.sh
```

Must show: feature inventory and registry generated; the exact Phase-1 validator
passes; the complete validator rejects a missing and malformed steal-map and
accepts a valid caller-authored fixture; existing-checkout ref mismatch and
output symlinks fail closed; in security mode `validate-security-audit.sh`
exits 0 only after the scaffold is completed and the secret scan passes.

## Examples

### Reverse-engineer an OSS CLI (repo mode) → steal-map

Run Phase 1 for `cc-sdd` with `--mode=repo --upstream-repo="https://github.com/gotalab/cc-sdd.git" --upstream-ref=v1.0.0`. It clones the pinned source, scans the surface, writes inventory/registry/specs, and validates the teardown. Then inspect our live surfaces, author each `have`/`gap`/`steal`/`park`/`reject` row in `steal-map.md`, and run the complete-output validator. Supply selected steals to Plan.

### Binary analysis with security audit

Run the skill for `ao` with `--authorized --mode=binary --binary-path="$(command -v ao)" --security-audit`. It performs authorized static analysis plus the security suite under `output_dir/security/`; the secret-scan check must pass.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Refuses binary analysis | Missing `--authorized` | Add `--authorized` (explicit written authorization required). |
| No `clone-metadata.json` | `--upstream-repo` not passed | Pass `--upstream-repo` (and optionally `--upstream-ref`). |
| Fixture diff fails | Upstream changed / stale golden | Re-run pinned, refresh `fixtures/`, commit. |
| Existing teardown is under `.agents/research/` | It used the earlier default | Pass that exact directory with `--output-dir`; new runs otherwise use the scratch default. |
| `spec-cli-surface.md` missing | No Node/Python/Go CLI detected | Surface is documented in `spec-code-map.md` instead. |
| Steal-map is all "steal" | Skipped the park/reject rules | Substrate we delegate is **park**; doctrine conflicts are **reject** — not everything novel is worth adopting. |

## Quality Rubric

- [ ] Every steal-map row cites teardown evidence **and** our matching surface (or "none").
- [ ] Verdicts use the full set — `have`/`gap`/`steal`/`park`/`reject` — not everything marked "steal".
- [ ] Facts on *how* they implement come from code and a fresh independent check — not a README.
- [ ] One-way-door adoptions are supplied to Plan, not decided here.
- [ ] Secret-scan gate passed over all outputs; no proprietary source/prompts reproduced.
