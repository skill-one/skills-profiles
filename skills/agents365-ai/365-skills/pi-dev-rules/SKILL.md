# Pi Dev Rules

Pi is a **minimal terminal coding harness**: lightweight core, extended through TypeScript
customizations. Package: `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. Maintained by Earendil Inc. (MIT).
This skill mirrors the official docs at <https://pi.dev/docs/latest> so you can answer Pi questions
and build Pi customizations without re-fetching. Three further bundles describe material that has
no page on the website: the **internal monorepo architecture** (Chord runtime, agent harness) and
the repository's own development/contribution rules. They are built from the pi source tree.

## When to use this skill

- Installing, authenticating, or launching Pi; explaining CLI flags / slash commands.
- Configuring providers, API keys, custom models (`models.json`), or proxies.
- Editing `settings.json`, keybindings, themes; understanding sessions & compaction.
- Understanding the **project-trust security model** and running Pi in containers/sandboxes.
- **Extending Pi**: writing extensions, skills, prompt templates, packages, custom providers, TUI UI.
- Checking Pi's version history / what changed in a recent release.
- Driving Pi programmatically via the SDK, RPC mode, or JSON event-stream mode.
- Setting up Pi on Windows/Termux/tmux/specific terminals, or building it from source.
- Understanding **why Pi is designed the way it is**: the creator's philosophy (minimal core, 4
  tools, YOLO by default; the 2025-11-30 manifesto lists MCP, plan mode, to-dos, and sub-agents as
  deliberate non-features, and built-in MCP landed later, on 2026-09-29) and how to configure or
  extend Pi along those lines instead of against them.
- Working **inside** the pi monorepo: the `@earendil-works/chord` runtime (plugin loading,
  service catalogue, RPC transport, delta/replicated state), the agent harness, facets/services,
  and the experimental `server`/`client`/`protocol` packages.

## Starter plugins

Every Pi user should install these three (same author, battle-tested):

```bash
pi install npm:pi-subagents       # subagents / loop / chain / parallel
pi install npm:pi-lens            # real-time LSP diagnostics
pi install npm:pi-web-access      # web search, URL fetch, YouTube, PDF
```

Then `pi list` to verify, restart Pi. MCP needs no package: it is built in since 2026-09-29 (see
`references/mcp.md`). An extension that registers `/mcp`, such as `pi-mcp-adapter`, replaces the
built-in support instead of adding to it.

## Cheat sheet

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent   # install (or: curl -fsSL https://pi.dev/install.sh | sh)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...                               # or run /login in-session
cd /path/to/project && pi                                          # start interactive (may prompt to trust the project)

pi update                                 # update Pi itself (pi update self / pi update --self are aliases)
pi list                                   # list installed packages
pi -c                       # continue most recent session
pi -r                       # browse/resume sessions
pi --session <path|id>      # open specific session
pi --fork <path|id>         # fork a session
pi --no-session             # ephemeral (no save)
pi -a / -na                 # trust / don't trust project-local files for this run

pi -p "Summarize this codebase"                 # print mode (non-interactive)
pi @README.md "Summarize this"                  # attach files/images with @
cat file | pi -p "..."                          # pipe stdin
pi --provider openai --model gpt-4o "..."       # pick provider/model
pi --model sonnet:high "..."                    # model:thinkingLevel
pi --tools read,grep,find,ls -p "..."           # allowlist tools (-xt to exclude)
pi --mode json "..." | jq -c 'select(.type=="message_end")'   # JSON stream
pi --mode rpc                                   # JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout

# In-editor: @file (fuzzy), !cmd (run+send), !!cmd (run, hidden), /command, Ctrl+L model, Shift+Tab thinking, Ctrl+X copy
# While the agent runs: Enter queues a steering msg, Alt+Enter a follow-up, Esc aborts + restores
```

**Key locations** (global `~/.pi/agent/`, project `.pi/`):
`settings.json`, `auth.json`, `models.json`, `keybindings.json`, `trust.json`, `AGENTS.md`,
`SYSTEM.md`, `extensions/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/`, `sessions/`.

## Hard rules

- **Install package name is exactly** `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` with `--ignore-scripts`.
- **Project context file is `AGENTS.md`** (Pi also reads `CLAUDE.md`); put it in the project root.
- **Extensions run with full system permissions**: treat them as trusted code; gate dangerous
  ops (`rm`, `sudo`, sensitive paths) with `ctx.ui.confirm` or a `tool_call` block handler.
- **Project trust is an input-loading guard, not a sandbox.** Pi ships no built-in sandbox; a project
  is "trusted" only to decide whether to load its `.pi/` resources (settings/extensions/skills/
  prompts/themes); decisions live in `~/.pi/agent/trust.json`, governed by `defaultProjectTrust`
  (`ask`/`always`/`never`), overridable per run with `--approve`/`--no-approve`. For untrusted repos
  or unattended runs, isolate with a container/VM (Gondolin/Docker/OpenShell); don't mount host
  `~/.pi/agent` unless the sandbox should see host credentials.
- **MCP is built in since 2026-09-29**, configured in `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` or a project `.pi/
  mcp.json`; the project file is read only after the project is trusted, because stdio servers run
  commands. MCP calls go through the tool pipeline, so `tool_call` handlers and permission gates
  apply (`codemode` calls carry `parentToolCallId`). Installing an extension that registers `/mcp`
  (`pi-mcp-adapter`) disables the built-in support; disable it deliberately with `"extensions":
  ["-builtin:mcp"]` or `pi config`.
- **In extension/SDK tools: throw on error, never return an error flag.** Pi wraps a thrown error
  into an error tool result (`isError: true`); the docs defer to `ToolDefinition` in
  `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts` for the exact contract. Limit tool output to
  ~50KB / 2000 lines (`DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES = 50 * 1024`). Use `StringEnum` (from
  `@earendil-works/pi-ai`) for LLM-facing enums.
- **Skill `name`**: 1–64 chars, lowercase `a-z 0-9 -`, no leading/trailing or consecutive hyphens;
  `description` ≤1024 chars and must say *when* to load it (a skill with no description won't load).
- **`chord.md` and `agent-harness.md` describe internals, not a stable contract.** Chord is
  published but application-neutral, the harness docs are implementation specifications, and
  `PLANNING.md`/`server`/`client`/`protocol` are explicitly experimental. Quote them as the
  current source tree state (pi@`d86654abb`), not as promised API.
- **`auth.json` holds API keys and OAuth tokens**: Pi writes it `0600`, keep it private and out of
  version control. Credential priority: CLI `--api-key` → `auth.json` →
  env var → custom-provider keys in `models.json`.
- Project settings override agent-directory settings, and resource lists are combined rather than
  replaced (per-model objects such as compaction thresholds merge before the model lookup). Use
  `pi install -l` to write a package declaration to `.pi/settings.json`, which Pi reads only after
  the project is trusted.
