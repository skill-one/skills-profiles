# Journal Impact Factor Lookup

Look up journal impact factors using a two-source cascade: bundled CSV cache (~200 common journals) → OpenAlex API (approximate 2-year IF for any journal).

**Critical rule:** Always use `journal_if.py` for lookups. Never guess impact factors — they change yearly and vary by edition.

## Quick Reference

| User wants... | Tier | Command |
| --------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Look up IF of a journal | read | `python3 journal_if.py lookup "Nature Medicine"` |
| Search for a journal | read | `python3 journal_if.py search "cancer immunology"` |
| Process a list of journals | read | `python3 journal_if.py batch journals.txt` |
| Cache-only (no network) | read | `python3 journal_if.py --offline lookup "Cell"` |
| Inspect cache state | read | `python3 journal_if.py cache status` |
| Refresh upstream CSV | write | `python3 journal_if.py cache update` |
| Machine-readable CLI contract | read | `python3 journal_if.py schema` |
| Schema for one subcommand | read | `python3 journal_if.py schema lookup` |

### Output format

Stdout is a stable JSON envelope when the CLI is **not** attached to a terminal
(piped or captured by an agent), and a human-readable view when run on a TTY.
To force a format: `--format json|table|human|auto`. `--json` is a back-compat
alias for `--format json`.

Envelope shape:

- Success: `{ "ok": true, "data": {...}, "meta": { "schema_version", "cli_version", "latency_ms" } }`
- Partial success (batch): `{ "ok": "partial", "data": { "succeeded": [...], "failed": [...] }, "meta": {...} }`
- Error: `{ "ok": false, "error": { "code", "message", "retryable", ... }, "meta": {...} }`

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0`  | success (including partial success) |
| `1`  | runtime / upstream error |
| `2`  | validation / bad input (missing file, bad flag) |
| `3`  | not found (no journal matched) |

### Error codes (inside `error.code`)

| Code | Retryable | Exit | Meaning |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ | --------- |
| `not_found` | no | 3 | Lookup completed but no source matched |
| `upstream_unavailable` | **yes** | 1 | OpenAlex API failed transiently; retry later or use `--offline` |
| `file_not_found` | no | 2 | Input file path does not exist |
| `validation_error` | no | 2 | Bad argument or flag combination |
| `runtime_error` | yes | 1 | Unexpected internal error |

## Data Sources

1. **Bundled CSV** — ~200 top journals across life sciences, medicine, chemistry, physics, and engineering. Curated from JCR data, shipped with the skill. Always available, instant.

2. **OpenAlex API** — Free, open API that computes an approximate 2-year impact factor from citation counts. Covers virtually all academic journals. The number **differs from the official JCR IF** — it's a citation-rate metric computed from the same formula (citations in year Y to items published in Y-1 and Y-2, divided by citable items in those two years) but using OpenAlex's own article classification. Adequate for ranking and comparison; do not cite as "the JCR impact factor" in formal contexts.

### When to use which

| Scenario | Source |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Quick check of a major journal | Bundled CSV (instant) |
| Niche or newer journal | OpenAlex fallback (automatic) |
| Formal submission / grant | Note: OpenAlex IF ≠ official JCR IF. Cite only as approximate. |
| Batch processing many journals | CSV for cached ones, OpenAlex for misses |
| Offline / air-gapped | `--offline` flag (bundled CSV only) |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Intent

| Intent | Action |
| -------- | -------- |
| "What's the IF of Nature?" | `lookup "Nature"` |
| "Compare IF of Cell and Science" | Run `lookup` twice, compare results |
| "Which immunology journals have IF > 20?" | `search "immunology"` then filter |
| "Process this list of journals" | `batch journals.txt` |
| "Is this a high-impact journal?" | `lookup` then interpret IF in field context |

### Step 2: Execute

Run the appropriate `journal_if.py` command. The script handles:

1. **Local CSV lookup** (instant, ~200 curated journals)
2. **OpenAlex API fallback** (automatic, approximate 2-year IF)
3. **Fuzzy matching** — catches minor name variations

### Step 3: Present Results

- Show the journal name, impact factor, and data year
- Note the source (CSV cache vs OpenAlex approximate)
- For search results: show a table with IF, year, and category

## Understanding Impact Factor

| IF Range | Typical Tier | Example |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------- |
| > 30 | Elite (top 0.1%) | Nature (64.8), Science (56.9), Cell (64.5) |
| 20–30 | Exceptional (top 1%) | Cancer Cell (50.3), Immunity (32.4) |
| 10–20 | Excellent (top 5%) | Nature Communications (16.6), Sci Adv (13.6) |
| 5–10 | Strong (top 15%) | eLife (7.7), Cell Reports (8.8) |
| 2–5 | Solid | PLOS ONE (3.7), Sci Rep (4.6) |
| < 2 | Niche / new | Many field-specific and new journals |

**Caveats:**

- IF varies dramatically by field — a top mathematics journal may have IF < 5 while a mid-tier oncology journal has IF > 10.
- Always compare IF within the same field.
- The IF data year matters; values shift annually.
- OpenAlex approximate IF differs from official JCR IF; treat as a ranking metric, not a certified number.

## Batch Processing

Create a text file with one journal name per line:

```
Nature Medicine
Journal of Biological Chemistry
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
```

Then run:

```bash
python3 journal_if.py batch journals.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| ------- | --------- |
| "No data found" | Try a shorter/alternative name; use `search` for fuzzy matching |
| OpenAlex returns 0 or None IF | The journal may be too new (needs 2+ years of data); use `--offline` to check cache only |
| OpenAlex IF differs from JCR | Expected — OpenAlex uses its own article classification. Use for ranking, not formal citation. |
| Cache download fails | Check network; the bundled CSV still works offline |
| Wrong journal matched | Use more specific name; the fuzzy matcher picks the closest substring match |
