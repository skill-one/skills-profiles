# Self-Healing

Active runtime recovery for coding agents. When something breaks, run the loop: **diagnose → patch → verify → file**. Leave behind a reusable, verified artifact instead of a swept-under-the-rug failure.

The premise mirrors [browser-use/browser-harness](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-harness): *the harness improves itself every run*. An agent that hits a gap doesn't fail — it writes the fix during execution, verifies it works, and files the durable artifact for future runs. Coding tasks deserve the same loop.

## What this skill is for

When a coding agent hits a wall mid-task, the default failure modes are:

1. **Paper over it** — "let me try a different approach" — and lose the recovery
2. **Pretend the fix worked** — without re-running the broken thing
3. **Symptom-fix** — skip the test, swallow the error, retry until green

All three turn a one-time failure into a recurrence. The next agent on the same project hits the same wall.

This skill enforces one discipline: **verify before persist**. A patch isn't real until you've re-run the failing operation and watched it succeed. When it does, file the verified fix so the next run benefits.

## Relationship to self-improvement

These two skills are deliberately split. Run both — they feed each other but don't overlap.

| Aspect      | `self-healing` (this skill)                                          | `self-improvement`                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **When**    | During execution, failure is live                                    | After the fact, at natural breakpoints                        |
| **Verb**    | Heal now — restore working state                                     | Remember for later — accumulate knowledge                     |
| **Outcome** | Verified patch + (optional) reusable artifact                        | Logged learning, correction, request                          |
| **Verify**  | **Mandatory** — no persist without proof                             | Not required                                                  |
| **Files**   | `.learnings/HEALS.md` + `.learnings/heals/<HEAL-ID>/` (lazy)         | `.learnings/ERRORS.md`, `LEARNINGS.md`, `FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` |
| **Trigger** | Failure observed mid-task                                            | Correction, knowledge gap, feature request, recurrence        |

**Boundary rule:** if you're capturing a fact, a correction, or a wish — that's `self-improvement`. If you're applying and verifying a fix to a live failure — that's `self-healing`.

## The Heal Loop

```
  ● failure observed
  │
  ● 1. DIAGNOSE  capture context — command, error, env, what was attempted
  │              search HEALS.md for the same Pattern-Key first
  │              (most heals are recurrences; don't reinvent)
  │
  ● 2. PATCH     write the fix — script, helper, env tweak, alt command
  │              artifacts → .learnings/heals/<HEAL-ID>/  (only if needed)
  │
  ● 3. VERIFY    re-run the failing op — must succeed
  │              ↻ if still failing: refine and retry, cap at 3 attempts
  │              ✗ if uncrackable: file Status: abandoned with notes
  │
  ● 4. FILE      write HEAL-YYYYMMDD-XXX to .learnings/HEALS.md
  │              with Pattern-Key, status, verification proof
  │
  ✓ working state restored, heal persisted

  (conditional) PROMOTE  if Pattern-Key recurrence ≥ 3 across distinct tasks,
                          append a Handoff block → self-improvement promotes to memory
```

If you abandon a heal mid-loop, don't pretend it succeeded. File a `HEAL-` entry with `Status: abandoned` and notes on what didn't work. The next agent learns from the dead end too.

## When to trigger

Self-healing fires on **active failures during execution** — the agent has just observed something not working and needs to make it work to continue. Five shapes:

### 1. Tool failure (command / test / build / lint)
Any invocation exits non-zero or produces wrong output. Don't acknowledge and retry verbatim — diagnose, patch, verify.

*Examples:* `npm install` errors when a `pnpm-lock.yaml` is present (switch tool); `pytest` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError` (activate the venv); `tsc` flags a stale type (regenerate the client); `eslint` reports a config error (install the missing parser).

### 2. Missing capability / tool gap
The agent needs something that doesn't exist yet — a script, a helper, a wrapper, a glue function. Write it in the moment. This is the closest analog to browser-harness's `agent_helpers.py`.

*Examples:* dedupe a CSV by custom key (write a small Python helper); bootstrap 12 microservices the same way (write `scripts/bootstrap-all.sh`); bulk-rename branches matching a pattern (write a `gh`-based shell helper).

### 3. Environment issue
The local environment isn't what the project expects. Detect, patch, verify.

*Examples:* runtime version mismatch (`nvm use`, `pyenv local`, `rustup override`); stale dependency cache after a branch switch; dirty git state blocking a checkout; missing `.env` (copy from `.env.example` and surface gaps).

### 4. External service / API change
A service the agent depends on returns something unexpected. Find a workaround and capture it.

*Examples:* an MCP tool returns `InputValidationError` because the schema changed (patch the call shape); a public API hits a rate limit (back off, switch endpoint, batch); an upstream lib bumped a default and broke a script (pin the version).

### 5. About-to-retry-the-same-broken-approach
The agent catches itself about to redo the failing step. That self-recognition is a heal forming — capture the alternate approach as the patch.

### Detection signals to watch for

- Non-zero exit codes
- Stack traces in tool output
- The same operation failing twice with the same error
- "I'll try a different approach" — capture it as a heal
- `command not found` / `module not found` / `permission denied`
- Stale assertions, snapshot mismatches, type errors that weren't there before
- "Weird" output that suggests environmental rather than logical bugs

## Classify before retrying

Before any retry, classify the failure from observed evidence:

- **Deterministic** — the same input or call shape produces the same validation, parser, schema, or
  query-planning error. Do not retry unchanged. Change the diagnosis or input materially, validate
  locally when possible, then make at most the remaining bounded attempts.
- **Transient** — rate limits, transport failures, temporary service unavailability, or timeouts
  with evidence that the request may succeed later. Use bounded backoff and reduce load; do not fan
  out retries.
- **Shared-service/batch** — the same normalized failure appears across different item IDs. Stop the
  batch, report the common dependency, and run one changed pilot before resuming.

Normalize failure signatures by removing volatile timestamps, request IDs, and item IDs. A repeated
structured-output validation failure is deterministic even when it occurs in a new session. A
bounded query that repeatedly times out requires a different query plan or narrower input, not the
same call again. Different report IDs do not make identical metadata-service failures independent.

If the diagnosis cannot support one of these classifications, stop and gather evidence rather than
guessing. Never invent tool syntax or a success-shaped fallback.

## HEAL Entry Format

Append to `.learnings/HEALS.md` (create if missing):

```markdown
## [HEAL-YYYYMMDD-XXX] short_kebab_name

**Logged**: ISO-8601 timestamp
**Status**: verified | pending-verify | abandoned
**Trigger**: tool-failure | missing-capability | env-issue | external-change | <free-form>
**Active-Context**: (optional) — current skill, task phase, or workflow stage; omit if not applicable
**Area**: free-form tag — what part of the system (`build`, `tests`, `ci`, `auth`, `data-pipeline`, `mobile`, ...)
**Priority**: low | medium | high | critical

### Failure
What broke — concrete: the command, the error message, the action that was blocked. Include exit codes and verbatim error lines.

### Diagnosis
The root cause as understood after investigation. Why the obvious approach didn't work. Not a guess — what was actually verified during the heal.

### Fix
The patch that was applied. Verbatim commands, code snippets, or pointers to files under `.learnings/heals/<HEAL-ID>/`. Keep it minimal — just enough to reproduce.

### Verification
What was run after the fix and what it returned. Exit code, output snippet, test pass count. **This is the proof.** Without it, the entry is `pending-verify` or `abandoned`.

### Artifacts
(omit this section if no files were generated; otherwise list relative paths under `.learnings/heals/<HEAL-ID>/`)

### Metadata
- Related Files: path/to/file.ext
- See Also: HEAL-... | LRN-... | ERR-... (related entries)
- Pattern-Key: lower.snake.case key for recurrence detection (e.g. `env.lockfile_mismatch`)
- Recurrence-Count: 1
- First-Seen / Last-Seen: YYYY-MM-DD

---
```

### Field guidance

- **Status** — `verified` = the verify step passed. `pending-verify` = patch applied but couldn't be fully proven (sandboxed/offline/CI-only) — surface to the user. `abandoned` = patch didn't work or diagnosis was wrong — document what was tried.
- **Trigger** — free-form is fine. The listed values are common shapes; what matters is that the failure shape is described enough for future agents to match against.
- **Active-Context** — optional. Use it if your environment has a meaningful "what was I doing" tag (an active skill, a current task phase, a build stage, an agent role). Skip if not applicable. The browser-harness analog is the per-domain scoping of `domain-skills/<site>/`.
- **Area** — free-form. Pick whatever helps future agents find this. `frontend`, `data-pipeline`, `ci`, `auth`, `terraform`, `mobile`, `embedded` — anything that fits your project shape.
- **Pattern-Key** — lower.snake.case, stable, reusable across projects. Two heals with the same key are recurrences. `env.lockfile_mismatch` is good; `fixed_thing_tuesday` isn't.

## ID generation

Format: `HEAL-YYYYMMDD-XXX`. `XXX` is sequential 3-digit or 3-char random alphanumeric. Examples: `HEAL-20260524-001`, `HEAL-20260524-A7B`.

## Artifacts directory (lazy)

Only create `.learnings/heals/<HEAL-ID>/` when the heal generated something worth preserving. One-line fixes don't need a folder; the HEAL entry text is enough. Abandoned heals with no applied patch also skip the folder.

```
.learnings/
├── HEALS.md
├── ERRORS.md / LEARNINGS.md / FEATURE_REQUESTS.md  (self-improvement)
└── heals/
    └── HEAL-20260524-001/
        ├── helper.sh
        ├── patch.diff
        └── notes.md
```

**Put here:** generated scripts/helpers, patch files, supplementary notes, output captures that document the diagnosis.
**Don't put here:** project source changes (those go in the project tree, referenced via Related Files); secrets; output already captured in the HEAL text.

## Verification rules

Verify is the load-bearing wall. The whole point of self-healing over self-improvement is that the fix is *proven*, not theorized.

### What counts as proof

| Failure shape                         | Verification                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tool / command / test / build / lint  | Re-run the original invocation; expect exit 0 / pass               |
| Missing capability                    | Invoke the helper end-to-end on a real input; expect the intent    |
| Environment drift                     | Re-run the operation that triggered the diagnosis                  |
| External service workaround           | Re-run the failed call with the patch; expect a usable response    |

### Sandboxed / offline / CI-only failures

When you genuinely can't run the verify step (no network, no real remote, sandboxed shell, CI-only reproduction), file `Status: pending-verify` with:

- The exact command the user / CI should run
- The acceptance criteria — what counts as proof
- A simulated proof if you can construct one (e.g. a dry-run mode, a stub of the failing call, a sandbox script)

`pending-verify` is honest. Faking `verified` is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

### When to invest in a proof script

Most heals don't need a separate proof script — the verify step is just re-running the failing thing. Build a proper proof script when:

- The heal generates a reusable helper that needs to be exercised across cases
- The failure can't be reproduced live but can be reproduced in a sandbox (clean git repo, mock service, fake input)
- You expect the heal to be re-applied across projects — the proof script then doubles as a regression check

### If verification fails

1. **Once** — classify the failure, refine the patch or input materially, and retry. First diagnosis
   is often wrong.
2. **Twice** — step back and reconsider the diagnosis. For a repeated deterministic signature, stop
   unless the next attempt changes the diagnosis or input. For a shared-service signature, pause the
   batch and return control to the orchestrator.
3. **Three times** — stop. File `Status: abandoned` with notes on what you tried. Surface to the user. Don't flail.

### What does NOT count as verification

- "It looks right" / "I think this should work"
- Re-running a *different* command than the one that originally failed
- Suppressing the failure (`|| true`, `--ignore-errors`) — that's hiding
- Skipping or deleting the failing test — that's regression
- Passing because the cache was warm from before the fix

### Reversibility

Prefer reversible patches. If your heal modifies project files, capture the diff in `patch.diff`. If the heal is destructive (deletes generated files, rewrites locks), note it explicitly — a future agent reading the HEAL needs to know what was destroyed.

## Recurrence and promotion

Most heals are recurrences. Before filing a new HEAL, search:

```bash
grep -n "Pattern-Key: <your-pattern-key>" .learnings/HEALS.md
```

If found:

- Increment `Recurrence-Count`
- Update `Last-Seen`
- Add the current occurrence as a See Also link
- **Do not** create a duplicate entry

### Promotion threshold

Add a `Handoff` block to an existing entry when **all** are true:

- `Recurrence-Count >= 3`
- Seen across at least 2 distinct tasks
- Within a 30-day window (matches the promotion rule in `self-improvement` and the aggregators)
- The fix is generalizable (not project-specific in a way that's already in a memory file)

```markdown
### Handoff
- **Promoted To**: self-improvement at YYYY-MM-DD
- **Promotion Target**: CLAUDE.md | AGENTS.md | .github/copilot-instructions.md | new-skill
- **Distilled Rule**: One-line prevention guidance derived from the heal
```

Then `self-improvement` (or a learning aggregator) takes over: distills the rule, writes it into the right context file, or extracts a reusable skill. The HEAL stays for traceability.

## Anti-patterns

1. **Logging without verifying.** A HEAL filed before the fix is proven turns this into noisier self-improvement. If verify hasn't passed, the entry is `pending-verify` or `abandoned`.
2. **Healing the symptom, not the cause.** A failing test isn't healed by skipping it (`pytest.skip`, `it.skip`, `xit`). A flaky CI isn't healed by `--retry`. Find the root cause; if you can't, abandon honestly.
3. **Generating a new fix without trying existing ones first.** Search `HEALS.md` by Pattern-Key. Most heals are recurrences.
4. **Inventing helpers when the project already has them.** Look in `scripts/`, `Makefile`, `justfile`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml` first. Heal = write what's missing, not what's there.
5. **Scope creep.** A heal is scoped to one failure. Cleanup belongs in a quality pass; refactors are features. Scope creep makes heals unreviewable.
6. **Empty artifact folders.** Don't create `.learnings/heals/<HEAL-ID>/` if nothing goes in it.

## Best practices

1. **Heal eagerly, file always.** Even abandoned heals teach the next agent what doesn't work.
2. **Verify before persist.** The non-negotiable rule.
3. **Minimal and reversible patches.** A 3-line fix is a heal; a 300-line refactor is a feature.
4. **Stable Pattern-Keys.** `env.node_version_mismatch` is reusable; `fixed_the_thing_on_tuesday` isn't.
5. **Reference, don't duplicate.** Cross-link related HEAL/LRN/ERR via See Also.
6. **Hand off recurrences.** A heal seen 3 times deserves to be in the project's permanent memory.
7. **Don't gate the main tree on heal artifacts.** Files under `.learnings/heals/` are reference material; if a script becomes load-bearing, promote it to `scripts/`.
8. **Pilot shared dependencies.** Prove one changed request before resuming a batch that failed with
   one shared signature.

## Setup

```bash
mkdir -p .learnings        # heals/ is lazy — created only when artifacts exist
touch .learnings/HEALS.md
```

Gitignore choices match `self-improvement`. Keep heals local (`.learnings/` in `.gitignore`) or share them as team knowledge (don't gitignore — they become reviewable durable context).

## Hook integration

Automatic triggering on command failures is optional and agent-specific. See [`references/hooks.md`](references/hooks.md) for Claude Code / Codex configuration.

## Multi-agent use

The skill is agent-agnostic. The `.learnings/HEALS.md` format is plain markdown — any agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Copilot, Cursor, Aider, ...) can read and write it. Agents without hook support can be reminded via their instruction file (e.g. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`). See [`references/hooks.md`](references/hooks.md) for examples.

## Pipeline integration

How self-healing slots into a larger skill pipeline (with upstream surfacing of past heals, downstream promotion of recurrences, and machine-verification gates) is documented in [`references/pipeline-integration.md`](references/pipeline-integration.md). Not required to use this skill — it stands alone.
