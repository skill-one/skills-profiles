# Pre-Flight Check

Surfaces relevant accumulated knowledge at the start of a session. This is the bridge that connects the outer loop back into the inner loop — it makes prior learnings visible before the agent starts work.

Without this, accumulated `.learnings/` are invisible to new sessions. The agent repeats mistakes that were already captured because nobody told it to look.

## When It Runs

- **Automatically** via SessionStart hook (lightweight scan, ~100-200 tokens)
- **Manually** before major tasks (deep scan with area filtering)

## Hook Output (Automatic — Lightweight)

The SessionStart hook (`scripts/pre-flight.sh`) does a fast scan and outputs a brief reminder if there are relevant signals:

```xml
<pre-flight-check>
Active learnings: N entries in .learnings/
Recent errors (last 7 days): N
Promotion-ready patterns: N
Failed evals: N

High-priority items:
- [Pattern-Key]: [one-line summary] (seen N times)
- [Pattern-Key]: [one-line summary] (seen N times)

Consider running /learning-aggregator if promotion-ready count > 0.
</pre-flight-check>
```

If there are no signals (empty `.learnings/`, no failed evals), the hook outputs nothing — zero overhead.

## Manual Deep Scan

When invoked explicitly, the pre-flight check does a deeper analysis:

### Step 1: Scan .learnings/

Read `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md`, `.learnings/ERRORS.md`, `.learnings/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md`, and `.learnings/HEALS.md` (the last from `self-healing` — verified runtime fixes filed during prior sessions; surface these prominently so the agent applies known fixes before reinventing them).

For each entry, extract:
- Pattern-Key, Summary, Priority, Status, Area, Related Files, Recurrence-Count, Last-Seen
- For HEAL entries: also Active-Context, Trigger, and any Handoff block flagging promotion readiness

### Step 2: Scan .evals/ (if exists)

Read `.evals/EVAL_INDEX.md` for any failed or stale evals.

### Step 3: Check Context-Surfing Handoffs

Look for unread files in `.context-surfing/` (same as handoff-checker.sh but integrated).

### Step 4: Relevance Filter

If the user described the task area, filter learnings to:
- Entries whose `Area` matches the task
- Entries whose `Related Files` overlap with likely-touched files
- Entries with `Priority: high/critical` regardless of area
- Entries with `Recurrence-Count` >= 3 (promotion-ready by recurrence threshold — need attention)

### Step 5: Output

```markdown
## Pre-Flight Check

### Task Area: [inferred or stated]

### Relevant Learnings
| ID | Summary | Recurrence | Priority | Status |
|----|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| LRN-... | ... | 3 | high | pending |
| ERR-... | ... | 2 | medium | pending |

### Key Warnings
- [Pattern-Key]: "Concise warning based on learning" — seen N times, last on YYYY-MM-DD
- [Pattern-Key]: "Concise warning based on learning" — seen N times, last on YYYY-MM-DD

### Failed Evals
| Eval ID | Pattern-Key | Last Failed | Recovery Action |
|---------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| eval-... | ... | YYYY-MM-DD | ... |

### Handoff Files
- [filename] — from session on YYYY-MM-DD

### Recommendations
- [ ] Read handoff files before starting
- [ ] Run learning-aggregator (N promotion-ready patterns)
- [ ] Fix failed evals before starting new work
- [ ] Watch for [specific pattern] in [area]
```

## Integration

### Upstream (feeds from)
- `.learnings/*.md` — accumulated learning entries from self-improvement
- `.evals/EVAL_INDEX.md` — eval results from eval-creator
- `.context-surfing/` — handoff files from context-surfing

### Downstream (feeds into)
- **Inner loop context** — the agent starts work with awareness of known patterns
- **learning-aggregator** — if promotion-ready count is high, recommend running it
- **eval-creator** — if failed evals exist, recommend fixing before new work

### The Compounding Effect

This is where the blog's compounding happens:

```
Outer loop improves harness → pre-flight surfaces improvements → inner loop starts stronger
```

Every learning captured, every rule promoted, every eval created becomes visible at the next session start. The knowledge gaps get smaller with every cycle.

## Incremental Scanning (future enhancement)

The hook script can be extended to use a local cache file (`.pre-flight-cache.json`) storing last-known state — entry counts, scan date, high-priority items — so the next session start only re-scans entries newer than the cached state. This would enable **delta reporting** ("since your last session, 2 new errors were logged and 1 pattern crossed the promotion threshold") and keep the hook near-instant regardless of how large `.learnings/` grows. Not implemented today — the current hook scans directly on every session start.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not modify `.learnings/` files (read-only)
- Does not promote patterns (that's the harness-updater plugin agent, or a human applying the gap report when the plugin isn't installed)
- Does not run evals (that's eval-creator)
- Does not block execution — it surfaces information, the agent decides what to act on
