# Voice Batch Runner

## Use When
- Persona, concept, and script inputs already exist and the next step is hosted
  voice design, cloned voice take generation, or polling.
- The voice should remain a durable persona asset across scripts, not a one-off
  audio byproduct.

## Do Not Use When
- The task belongs to ideation, QA, or another released skill listed in the handoff section.
- Required inputs are missing and guessing would change the result.
- Voice strategy, task class, translation policy, or lip-sync intent is still
  unresolved. Use `audio-generation` first.

## Execution Boundary
- This runner validates and executes normalized voice requests. It must not make
  creative strategy, voice-policy, or reference-policy decisions.
- Separate the workflow into voice profile, optional voice identity, and concrete
  voice take. The script text can change; persona voice continuity should not.
- Voice design is for an initial persona-aligned sound from `text`,
  `voice_description`, and `language`.
- Voice clone is for new script takes when approved reference `audio` and an
  optional `reference_text` should preserve timbre and speaking style.

## Source And Path
- Ground requests in the active project persona registry, voice baseline, script
  text, and video purpose/lane.
- Use the active project/client folder first; do not assume one client directory
  is the source base for all voice work.
- Keep internal request/response/run state under `.postplus` when it is not the
  user-facing handoff. Keep final audio and review files in the active voice
  asset folder, or state the chosen workspace path.

## Request Boundary
- Voice design synthesizes a persona voice from spoken `text`, a free-text
  `voice_description`, and an optional `language` (defaults to auto).
- Voice clone reproduces an approved voice from spoken `text`, an `audio`
  reference, an optional `reference_text` transcript, and optional `language`.
  Pass a local path, HTTPS URL, existing PostPlus media reference, or data URI
  directly to `--audio`. The CLI validates and prepares local media before the
  single hosted submit; do not pre-upload it or construct a manual request.
- Exact field names, requiredness, and defaults are discovered from
  `postplus media schema --json` and the generated example below; do not hard-code
  a private request envelope here.

## Review And Handoff
- Before generation, verify persona registry, voice baseline, script stability,
  route (`voice_design` or `voice_clone_take`), source basis, and output path.
- After generation, review realism, persona fit, pacing, ad-like delivery,
  reuse potential, and for cloned output, timbre/accent drift from the reference.
- If pending, preserve the result path and follow the returned CLI action or
  resume command for the same operation; do not submit a replacement job.
  Stop and report at the CLI wait/recovery boundary.
- Save a finished take with `postplus media-file download`, using the completed
  result's artifact reference when present or its output URL otherwise.

## Stop Conditions
- Stop when required user intent, source evidence, or owned input artifacts are
  missing and guessing would change the result.

- Batch isolation: when producing a batch of independent items, a per-item
  content/safety rejection is isolated to that item. It is identified
  only by the typed code `postplus_cli_hosted_media_content_policy_blocked`,
  never by matching error prose, and it surfaces at either boundary: a failed
  `postplus media create` whose typed error `code` is that code, or a
  submitted run whose poll result carries `output.data.status: failed` and
  `output.data.error.code` set to that code. On either, record which item was
  blocked and its exact reason, skip it, and continue submitting and polling
  the remaining items, then report the incomplete set at the end. Do not retry,
  soften, or re-submit the blocked item — that is a forbidden payload rewrite.
  Every other failure (a failed owned CLI/script command whose typed `code` is
  not that content-policy code, or a run whose `error.code` is not that
  content-policy code — auth, transport, quota, malformed request, service
  outage) is systemic: stop per the rule above.

## Public Command Boundary

- Choose the smallest matching command or workflow from the user input and run
  it directly.
- Readiness diagnostics: `postplus doctor --skill voice-batch-runner`.
- Poll a pending voice take: `postplus media poll --handle <output.data.id>`
  only when that is the returned action; honor its wait/recovery boundary.

- Use `postplus media schema --json` only when constructing or repairing an unknown request shape.
- Run the hosted submit with the generated command below; do not use another execution interface.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED EXECUTION EXAMPLE -->
```bash
postplus media create voice-design \
  --text "example text" \
  --voice-description "example voice_description" \
  --wait \
  --output ./result.json
```

Follow the CLI's structured result and reported next action; do not infer recovery from free-text messages.
Wait for explicit user approval when requested; an action does not authorize spending, publishing, or overwriting.
Resume the same operation through its returned checkpoint or action; never resubmit uncertain work, repeat exhausted recovery, or switch providers to bypass failure.
<!-- END GENERATED EXECUTION EXAMPLE -->

- If the CLI returns a quote-confirmation challenge, obtain user approval for its scope and cost before running `postplus quote confirm --json --challenge-file <challenge.json>` and retry with the returned token.
