## Cross-Domain Routing

**Camera + permissions** (camera access denied, Info.plist missing):
- Camera code → **stay here** (camera-capture)
- Privacy manifest / Info.plist → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)
- Build/entitlement errors → **invoke axiom-build**

**ShazamKit + microphone permissions**:
- Microphone NSMicrophoneUsageDescription → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)
- ShazamKit API and matching → **stay here** (shazamkit)

**Now Playing + background audio**:
- Now Playing metadata/controls → **stay here** (now-playing)
- Background audio mode / BGTaskScheduler → **invoke axiom-integration** (background-processing reference)

**Speech-to-text + audio capture** (transcribing mic or asset audio):
- `SpeechAnalyzer` / `SpeechTranscriber`, the ~2-simultaneous-analyzer cap, the `OS27` input providers → **invoke axiom-ai** (`skills/ios-ml.md`)
- Audio session category/mode, `AVCaptureSession` wiring → **stay here** (avfoundation-ref, camera-capture)
- **The trap**: `CaptureInputSequenceProvider.providerWithSession(...)` (`OS27`) automatically reconfigures your app's default `AVAudioSession`. If this suite's audio-session setup "randomly breaks" after transcription is added, that's the cause — use `provider(from:in:)` and add its `captureAudioDataOutput` to your own session.

**Apple Music library + playback + persistence**:
- Enumerating the library, library identity, `PlayParameters` availability, Sync Library hazards → **stay here** (music-library)
- Queuing and playing what you found, Now Playing publishing → **stay here** (now-playing-musickit)
- Storing library rows in your own database (which column is the durable key, migrations for a re-key) → **invoke axiom-data** — but take the identity rules from music-library first; `persistentID` is not a durable key
- `MusicAuthorization` prompt copy / privacy manifest → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)

**Photo library + privacy**:
- Photo picker (PHPicker, PhotosPicker) → **stay here** (photo-library) — no permissions needed
- Full PHPhotoLibrary access → **stay here** (photo-library-ref) — limited access model
- Privacy manifest for photo usage → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)

**DockKit + camera / custom inference**:
- DockKit stand control, framing, motor, tracking states → **stay here** (dockkit)
- Underlying AVCaptureSession setup → **stay here** (camera-capture)
- Custom Vision / Core ML inference feeding observations → **invoke axiom-vision**
- Camera permission (NSCameraUsageDescription) → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)

**MediaIntelligence + Vision** (faces, image analysis):
- Group faces into people across a library, video highlights / key frames → **stay here** (media-intelligence) — clustering identities + on-device video moment detection
- Detect *where* a face is in one image (bounding box, landmarks), OCR, segmentation → **invoke axiom-vision** — per-image detection, a different problem
- System Photos "People" album → that album is system-owned (PhotoKit); MediaIntelligence builds *your own* index over assets you manage → **stay here** (photo-library for the asset access)

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Camera capture is just AVCaptureSession setup" | Camera has interruption handlers, rotation, and threading requirements. |
| "Camera launch is fast enough if I startRunning() early" | Output initialization dominates launch; iOS 26 deferred start halves time-to-preview. |
| "I'll add haptics with a simple API call" | Haptic design has patterns for each interaction type matching HIG. |
| "ShazamKit is just SHSession + a delegate" | iOS 17+ has SHManagedSession which eliminates all AVAudioEngine boilerplate. |
| "Now Playing info is just setting metadata" | Remote commands, artwork handling, and state sync have 15+ gotchas. |
| "I'll use UIImagePickerController for photos" | PHPicker/PhotosPicker are the modern API — no permissions required. |
| "MediaPlayer reports fewer playlist members than MusicKit, so sync is incomplete" | The gap is structural, not a sync signal: it tracks the entries with no local representation — exact on all five playlists inspected, off by one library-wide. A shipped guard built on this premise silently skipped 9 of 15 playlists forever. Read `skills/music-library.md`. |
| "Reading the music library is just a MusicLibraryRequest" | Reading one MusicKit property across a large library leaves every later MusicKit request unresumed for the rest of the run, with no error thrown. Pool starvation is a symptom, not the mechanism — a plain `Thread`, which never touches the pool, loses MusicKit identically. Batching the request is ~100x *slower*, not safer. |
| "`Song.id` is a stable key I can store" | Its *format* differs per device for the same library (`i.…` on one, bare numeric on another). Never parse it, never use it as a cross-device key. |
| "DockKit is just pairing a stand" | Custom control needs system tracking disabled, handles inverted dock states, and two different coordinate origins. |
| "Grouping faces is just Vision face detection" | Vision detects faces in one image; MediaIntelligence clusters them into persistent people (entities) across a whole library, with its own working directory and state. |
| "Casting to Chromecast means bundling the Google Cast SDK" | On iOS 27, AVSystemRouting exposes non-AirPlay routes as system routes — you adopt one Apple API (observe events, start a session, drive playbackControl) instead of a per-vendor SDK. Likely EU-gated — gate and keep a fallback. |
| "I'll sync SharePlay playback by broadcasting the current time over the messenger" | The messenger has no clock. `AVDelegatingPlaybackCoordinatorPlayCommand.hostClockTime` gives you an absolute `CMClockGetHostTimeClock()` start time; hand-rolling reinvents startup barriers, seek ordering, stalls, and interruptions badly. |
| "The playback coordinator handles interruptions for me" | Only `AVPlayerPlaybackCoordinator` does. `AVDelegatingPlaybackCoordinator` adds **no** automatic suspensions — a custom engine begins *and* ends every one, and a suspension never ended hangs the whole group. |
| "ScreenCaptureKit on iPad works like the Mac (enumerate displays/windows)" | On iOS/iPadOS `SCShareableContent` and all `SCContentFilter` initializers are macOS-only — you get a filter ONLY from the system `SCContentSharingPicker`. New on iOS/iPadOS/tvOS/visionOS 27. Also not `ImageRenderer` (that snapshots your own SwiftUI view). |
