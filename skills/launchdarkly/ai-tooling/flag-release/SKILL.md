# Record a Flag's Automated Release

You're using a skill that takes an **existing** feature flag (created OFF) that guards a pull request's change, and records an **automated rollout** so the change releases safely once the PR merges — no human toggling a flag. It defers per-environment to the team's release policies and honors any human-stated release intent.

This is the **release step** of the PR flag workflow, and it's deliberately atomic:

| Step | Owned by |
|------|----------|
| Decide *whether* to flag | [`should-flag-change`](../should-flag-change/SKILL.md) (advisory) |
| Create the flag + wire the code | [`launchdarkly-flag-create`](../launchdarkly-flag-create/SKILL.md) |
| **Record the release** | **this skill** |

By the time this skill runs, the flag exists (OFF) and the guarding code is wired and pushed. This skill only records the rollout — it never creates flags or edits code. It can be driven directly by an automation harness, or as the final step of the [`flag-and-release-change`](../flag-and-release-change/SKILL.md) orchestrator.

**The deploy is not the release.** The merge ships the control path (flag OFF); the *release* is the flag operation this rollout performs afterward, governed by the environment's policy.

> **Honoring a hold is the one thing you must get right.** There is no "hold" release type, and **`policy` is NOT a manual gate.** On merge, `policy` *automatically* performs the environment's release (immediate, progressive, or guarded) with **no human promotion step** — a guarded rollout still *starts on its own* the moment the PR merges. So recording a held environment as `policy` does **not** hold it; it releases it on merge, before any `notBefore` date. The only way to hold an environment is to **omit it from the `environments` array entirely**, which leaves the flag OFF there. If the user wants an environment held (or not released until a date), exclude it from the call and report it as held. When in doubt, omit.

## Prerequisites

- The remotely hosted LaunchDarkly MCP server.
- The guarding flag already exists in LaunchDarkly, created OFF, with the agreed key/tags.
- A pull-request reference (`repoFullName` + `prNumber`, or `prUrl`) so the rollout binds to the right merge.

**MCP tools this skill uses:**
- `create-automated-rollout-config` — record the rollout for the flag against the PR *(the deliverable)*
- `match-release-policies` — resolve which release policy governs each environment (call before proposing the plan)
- `list-release-policies` — see the project's release policies and the metrics they auto-attach
- `get-flag` — confirm the flag exists and is OFF before recording

Full release model — `simple` vs `policy`, precedence, previewing, prerequisites, metric adequacy: [references/auto-release.md](references/auto-release.md).

## Plan Phase

**Record nothing in this phase.**

1. **Confirm the flag.** `get-flag` to verify the guarding flag exists and is OFF. If it doesn't exist yet, stop — creation is [`launchdarkly-flag-create`](../launchdarkly-flag-create/SKILL.md)'s job, and recording a rollout for a missing flag fails confusingly.
2. **Pick the target environments.** Use the environments named by the user or harness. Don't hardcode a set — a given change can't always release to every environment. If none are named, enumerate the project's real keys and confirm the set rather than assuming.
3. **Preview each environment's policy.** Call `match-release-policies` (by `flagKey` + `environmentKey`) to resolve, deterministically, what a `policy` release will do per environment — `winningReleaseMethod` (immediate / progressive / guarded / none). Don't reason about policy scope by hand. For a **guarded** winner, check the auto-attached metrics can actually compare this change (see the metric-adequacy note in [references/auto-release.md](references/auto-release.md)).
4. **Capture the human's release intent.** Ask (briefly, only if not already stated): release **on merge**, **hold** (recorded but not released yet), or wait until a **`notBefore`** date? A **cohort/segment** to target first? A **prerequisite** parent flag this must not precede? Intent sits above the policy in precedence and is **honored or explicitly held — never silently dropped**.
5. **Present the per-environment plan and stop.** For each environment, state either the `releaseType` it will be recorded with (`simple` / `policy`, and what that does on merge) **or** that it will be **held** — omitted from the recorded config so the flag stays OFF there — with the reason. Wait for confirmation; revise on feedback.

## Implement Phase

Only after confirmation:

1. **Sort every target environment into exactly one bucket — RELEASE or HOLD.** Do this *before* you build the call. There is no third bucket, and `releaseType` does not create one.

   | Bucket | Meaning | What goes in the call |
   |--------|---------|-----------------------|
   | **RELEASE** | Goes live on merge — now, or per its policy | Add `{ environmentKey, releaseType }` to the `environments` array |
   | **HOLD** | Not yet — waiting on a date, sign-off, segment, or parent flag | **Nothing.** Leave it out of `environments` entirely; name it as held in your report |

   `releaseType` (`simple` vs `policy`) only chooses *how* a RELEASE environment goes live — it never holds one. **Both release on merge:** `simple` serves `true` immediately; `policy` runs that environment's policy (immediate / progressive / guarded) automatically, with no human promotion step. "`policy` defers to the *policy*" — not to you, and not until a date. **Do not reach for `policy` to park a held environment: it ships that environment on merge, before any `notBefore`.** The only encoding of a hold is *absence from the array*.

2. **Build `environments` from the RELEASE bucket only — then read the keys back.** The array must contain every RELEASE environment and no HOLD environment. Before you send the call, scan the `environmentKey`s in the array: if any environment you're holding appears there, delete that entry. The call has **no field for a date or a hold** — if you catch yourself wanting to add `holdUntil`, `notBefore`, or `hold` to an entry (or to keep it as `policy` "so it waits"), that is the signal the environment is HOLD: **drop the entry, don't invent a field.** The date and reason go in your report, not the call.

   Worked example — *"release staging on merge, hold production until 2026-09-01"*: staging is RELEASE, production is HOLD.

   ```json
   {
     "projectKey": "default",
     "flagKey": "new-checkout-flow",
     "environments": [{ "environmentKey": "staging", "releaseType": "simple" }],
     "repoFullName": "acme/storefront",
     "prNumber": 482
   }
   ```

   `production` appears nowhere in the call. You report it held until 2026-09-01, with the reason (legal sign-off). Fail closed: if an environment's intent is unclear, it's HOLD, not RELEASE.

3. **Record the rollout.** Call `create-automated-rollout-config` with `projectKey`, `flagKey`, the RELEASE-only `environments` array, and the PR reference. If a **prerequisite** parent flag was agreed, wire it if the MCP surface supports it; otherwise report it as a manual step. Details: [references/auto-release.md](references/auto-release.md).
4. **Verify.** The call returns `created`, `config_id`, and the normalized per-environment plan — record `config_id`. Report only what you verified; flag anything you couldn't confirm rather than asserting it.
5. **Report** the per-environment release plan + `config_id`; what was **held** (and why) versus what releases on merge; and what happens on merge (e.g. "production resolves policy X → guarded rollout on merge; staging serves true immediately; production held until 2026-08-01 per intent").

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Flag doesn't exist yet | Stop — creation is `launchdarkly-flag-create`. Recording a rollout for a missing flag fails confusingly. |
| A rollout config already exists for this flag + PR | Don't record a second one — a duplicate confuses the scheduler. Point the user at the existing config to change the plan. |
| Registering before the PR exists | `simple` envs work without a PR, but `policy` envs need `repoFullName`/`prNumber` to trigger on merge. Prefer recording *after* the PR is open; if you record early, say `policy` won't fire until the PR is wired. |
| No release policy matches an env | `policy` falls back to defaults (often immediate). Tell the user; offer `simple`, or point at release-policy setup. |
| User wants to hold, or set a `notBefore` date | Skip the releasing plan for those environments; report them as held with the reason. Never silently release against stated intent. |
| Change depends on a parent flag not yet live | Couple them with a prerequisite (set it if the MCP surface supports it); otherwise report the coupling as a required manual step. Don't let this flag release before its parent. |
| A `policy` env resolves to guarded but has no relevant metric | Say so — a guarded rollout with no meaningful metric guards nothing. Recommend `simple`, or point at metric setup. |

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't create the flag or edit code** — that's `launchdarkly-flag-create`. This skill only records the release.
- **Don't turn the flag on yourself, or toggle it after recording the config.** The rollout owns that; double-toggling causes audit noise and confuses the scheduler.
- **Don't skip `match-release-policies`.** Proposing `policy` without knowing what it resolves to is guessing.
- **Don't silently release against a stated hold/`notBefore`.** Honor intent or hold — never drop it.
- **Don't handle or print credentials.** Access is injected by the environment.
