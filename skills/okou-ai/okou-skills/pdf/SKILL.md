# Extract a template package from a PDF

Input: one `.pdf`. Output: a loadable skill package whose instructions and
resources match the selected reuse scope.

**If the original .docx exists, use `../docx/SKILL.md` instead.** If the PDF's
pages are slides rather than a document, use `../presentation/SKILL.md`.

Run every command below from `extract-template/pdf/`.

If the original has not been rendered, render it before choosing scope:

```bash
node ../scripts/render-document.mjs --input <source.pdf> --out source-render
```

Use a new output directory for each render.

## Choose the reuse scope

Read [`../document-reuse.md`](../document-reuse.md), choose from representative
rendered pages and the user's purpose, then use the matching section below.
For style extraction, continue at [Style extraction](#style-extraction).

## Slot filling

Copy the source to `package/template.pdf`. Write `package/SKILL.md` with the
slot map and filling instructions from the shared guide. For each slot,
record its page, meaning and filling format. Use an existing PDF form field's
name where available; otherwise record the blank's rectangle and text
appearance from the page.

Instruct the skill to fill a copy of `template.pdf` through its form fields or
place text within the recorded blank areas. Keep the original page content
and artwork intact; do not reconstruct the page or replace its fixed prose.
Render the filled copy to verify the values fit and everything outside the
slots remains unchanged. Continue at Publish the source package.

## Structure and expression reuse

Copy the source to `package/example.pdf`. Write `package/SKILL.md` with the
structure and writing rules from the shared guide, including source examples
of the phrasing, tone and information order to reuse.

Record the layout of the blocks a new document needs, with their typography,
spacing and repeat-or-omit rules. Extract reusable artwork into the package
when needed. A PDF is a visual and writing example, not an editable paragraph
tree: tell the skill how to compose new content into that layout using the
example and packaged assets, allowing the recorded parts to grow or repeat.
Identify any wording that stays fixed. Render the result and compare both its
layout and expression with the example. Continue at Publish the source package.

## Publish the source package

```bash
node ../scripts/cover-page.mjs --input <the original .pdf> --out cover.png
```

```bash
npx --yes --package="${CLI_PKG_URL}" okou user-template publish \
  --title "<user-visible template name>" \
  --kind document \
  --source <the original .pdf> \
  --cover cover.png \
  --page-count <pageCount from cover-page.mjs> \
  --package package
```

Keep the source copy in `package/`; `--source` supplies the catalog document
and does not replace the files a later run needs. Publish without `--cover`
and `--page-count` only when `cover-page.mjs` failed; report what it said.
Say the template exists only after the command succeeds, then stop.

## Style extraction

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pymupdf
python3 scripts/ensure_pandoc.py --dir ./vendor   # then run the export PATH line it prints
```

### 1. Analyse

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_pdf.py <source.pdf> --json styles.json
```

Read the report:

- `[structure tree]` present → take the heading levels in step 3 from it.
- "No text layer" → OCR the PDF first, then restart.
- `[body candidates]` → the chosen group must be running prose. If its sample
  is a table header, an index or a caption, re-run with `--body <rank>`.

### 2. Declare the column count

Inspect the source page images. Re-run step 1 with `--columns N`.

### 3. Map the heading levels

Under `[inferred styles]`, decide each group's role from its sample text and
write the map:

```
--map 1=Heading1,2=Title,3=Heading2
```

Right side: `Title`, `Subtitle`, `Heading1`..`Heading9` or `skip`. The
largest group is usually the document title, not `Heading1`.

### 4. Settle the margins

Use the `suggested` row. Where `measured` disagrees with it by more than
rounding, measure the page yourself and pass `--top`, `--right` or `--left`
in cm. The bottom margin is never measured. Pass `--bottom` as:

- the `measured` bound, when some page is full to the bottom;
- for a Typst source with a footer, `(page height − footer baseline − 0.73 ×
  footer size) / 0.7`, in cm;
- otherwise the mirror of the top, which `suggested` already holds.

On a two-column document the two columns must come out the same width.

### 5. Build

```bash
python3 scripts/build_reference.py styles.json reference.docx \
        --map 1=Heading1,2=Title,3=Heading2 [--bottom 2.2 ...]
```

`--map` keys are the `#` column of `[inferred styles]`. Map every group that
is a heading; leave captions and footnotes unmapped.

### 6. Verify

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_roundtrip.py reference.docx styles.json \
        --map 1=Heading1,2=Title,3=Heading2
```

Same `--map` as step 5. Exit code must be 0. `NOT MEASURED` is not a failure.

### 7. Package

```bash
python3 scripts/make_package.py <source.pdf> reference.docx styles.json <out dir> \
        --map 1=Heading1,2=Title,3=Heading2 --body 2 [--bottom 2.2 ...]
```

Pass every flag used in steps 1–5. The output directory name is the skill
name; `--name` overrides it. Add anything the scripts could not measure to the
package's `Limits`.

### Optional: adjust styles, add a header or footer

```bash
python3 scripts/set_style.py reference.docx --list
python3 scripts/set_style.py reference.docx "Block Text" --size 10.5 --color 6C757D
python3 scripts/set_style.py reference.docx "Source Code" --create --font Consolas --size 9
python3 scripts/set_header_footer.py reference.docx --header "Company" --footer "Page " --page-number
python3 scripts/set_header_footer.py reference.docx --header 'Title\tv2.3'   # left / right
```

Then step 6 with `--structure-only`, then step 7.

### 8. Publish

```bash
node ../scripts/cover-page.mjs --input <source.pdf> --out cover.png
```

```bash
npx --yes --package="${CLI_PKG_URL}" okou user-template publish \
  --title "<user-visible template name>" \
  --kind document \
  --source <source.pdf> \
  --cover cover.png \
  --page-count <pageCount from cover-page.mjs> \
  --package <out dir>
```

Publish without `--cover` and `--page-count` only when `cover-page.mjs`
failed; report what it said. Say the template exists only after the command
succeeds.

## Rules

- Reproduce the source. Do not correct an inverted hierarchy or a style left
  at a default; the package records it.
- Steps 2–4 are not recorded in the PDF. Settle each against the evidence the
  step names, never the script's default.
- The running head and foot are rebuilt from `[running head/foot]`. If that
  line lists body text, the source has no header; run
  `set_header_footer.py reference.docx --clear`.
- Change the column layout only when asked.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| Every heading level is off by one | Redo step 3 from the `sample` column |
| Right margin far too large | No line fills the column; measure it off a page and pass `--right` |
| Single-page PDF gives bad margins | Running heads cannot be detected; measure all four and pass them |
| Paragraph metrics implausible, or the body candidate is a table | Re-run step 1 with `--body <rank>` |
| Body text splits into several groups | Real difference in size, colour or weight; keep the largest, `--map <n>=skip` the rest |
| Space after reads NOT MEASURED | No paragraph is followed by a paragraph; pandoc's default stays |
| Heading before/after look off | `set_style.py --before/--after`, then step 6 with `--structure-only` |
| Verify fails after a deliberate change | Re-run step 6 with `--structure-only` |
| Heading gaps near zero on a multi-column source | `--columns` was not passed; redo step 2 |
| A header or footer added later sits a few points off | Step 1 sets the distance from the font's hhea metrics; when it printed no `hhea` line, install the source's font and rerun, or pass `set_header_footer.py --header-distance PT --footer-distance PT` (page edge to the line box, baseline − 1.16 × size for Noto Sans CJK) |
| LibreOffice preview shows a smaller gap above a heading than the source | Expected. LibreOffice takes the larger of space-after and space-before; Word adds them, and the template is written for Word |
| Title→Subtitle or Subtitle→Heading gap doubles in Word | Both sides carry the same gap (Word adds them, LibreOffice takes the larger). Zero one side: `set_style.py reference.docx "Subtitle" --before 0` |
| A paragraph repeated on every page is listed as a running head | Body text in the header band. Pass the margins you measured; the styles are unaffected |
