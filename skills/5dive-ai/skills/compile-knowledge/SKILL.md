  Compile durable, judgement-shaped knowledge into interlinked markdown —
  atomic files, [[wiki-links]], a maintained index. Use when persistence is
  asked for explicitly ("save this", "write it to the wiki") or when the work
  produced a decision record, a cause, or a gap analysis; ordinary factual
  answers and routine task results are not a trigger.

# compile-knowledge

## When this fires

Two triggers, and only these:

1. **An explicit persistence ask** — "save this", "write this to the wiki",
   "update the wiki/memory", "log this finding", "structure this knowledge",
   "follow the karpathy method".
2. **Durable judgement-shaped output** — a decision record, the CAUSE behind a
   finding, a gap analysis, a non-obvious fact that cost real work to learn and
   would cost it again.

It does **not** fire on ordinary analytical work. Answering a factual question,
summarising a file, explaining code, or reporting a routine task result
produces nothing durable to compile. If the only thing you could write down is
a restatement of what the repository or the transcript already says, skip it.


Durable knowledge is worth keeping as many small, interlinked markdown files,
compiled over time and surfaced through an index — not as one giant doc, a chat
log, or a one-off file that rots. This skill makes compiling consistent so your
agent gets smarter over time instead of relearning the same things.

## Where it goes — pick the right store

- **Agent memory** (default, always available): your `.claude/.../memory/`
  folder with `MEMORY.md` as the index. This is the per-agent store and it
  survives restarts — it's the karpathy "external memory" that keeps you sharp
  across sessions. Governed by the memory rules already in your system prompt —
  follow them. For most agents this is the only store you need.
- **Shared wiki** (only if you work as a team): a `wiki/` folder in your project
  with a `wiki/index.md`. For knowledge the *whole team* benefits from — domain
  facts, research findings, reference material multiple agents would re-derive.
  Skip this entirely if you're a solo agent; don't manufacture team ceremony.

Rule of thumb: "only I act on this" → memory. "Anyone on my team might need
this" → shared wiki. Cross-link between them with `[[slug]]` when they relate.

## The async pipeline vs. you — division of labor

Some platforms run an automatic consolidation pass over finished sessions (on
5dive: `5dive memory consolidate`, scheduled for you by the heartbeat). If your
platform has one, know what it covers and what only you can do:

- **AUTOMATIC — plain facts.** The pass distils your FINISHED session
  transcripts into memory atoms in your own store. It never reads the live
  session, and nothing it writes leaves your box. You do NOT need to hand-copy
  plain facts out of a session to keep them — that is what stops knowledge
  dying with the context window.
- **STILL YOURS — judgement.** A wiki page, a decision and its reason, a gap
  analysis, the CAUSE behind a finding: the pipeline can only lift what is
  stated in the transcript, and a conclusion you drew is not lying there. It
  also cannot publish to a shared wiki — it has no store selector, and shared
  stores are deny-default by design — so publishing to the team store stays a
  curated act, and that act is yours.

This narrows what you compile; it does not replace compiling. Judgement-shaped
knowledge still goes through the procedure below, before you close the task.

## Before you write — the hygiene gate

Compile ONLY a durable, non-obvious fact. Skip and move on if it is:
- routine / derivable from the repo, git history, or existing docs,
- true only for this one conversation,
- already covered by an existing file (→ UPDATE that file instead, don't duplicate).

Most tasks (a deploy, a restart, a one-line fix) produce nothing durable. That is
fine — do not manufacture a memory to "have written something." Filler is worse
than nothing; it pollutes recall.

## The procedure

1. **Search first.** Look for an existing file on this topic (grep the store +
   skim the index). If one exists, edit it — never create a near-duplicate.
2. **Atomic.** One fact / one topic per file. If you're tempted to add a second
   unrelated fact, that's a second file.
3. **Name it.** kebab-case slug, with a type prefix for memory
   (`feedback_…`, `project_…`, `reference_…`, `user_…`) or a clear topic slug for
   the wiki. The slug is the link target.
4. **Frontmatter.** `name` (= the slug), `description` (ONE line — this is what
   gets matched during recall, make it specific), and a `type`/category.
5. **Body.** State the fact plainly. Link related entries with `[[slug]]` —
   liberally; a link to a file that doesn't exist yet is a fine TODO marker. For
   `feedback`/`project`, follow with **Why:** and **How to apply:** lines.
6. **Index.** Add or update a ONE-LINE pointer in the index (`MEMORY.md` for
   memory; `wiki/index.md` for the wiki): `- [Title](slug.md) — hook`. Keep it
   under ~200 chars; detail lives in the file, never the index. **If the wiki
   `index.md` doesn't exist yet, create it** so the store stays discoverable.
7. **Hygiene.** Delete files that turned out wrong. Convert relative dates to
   absolute. If the index is getting long, tighten lines — don't let it bloat.

## Lifecycle — supersede, don't silently overwrite

Facts rot. When one is time-sensitive, uncertain, or replaces an older one,
stamp the envelope so recall can age it out instead of surfacing stale truth:

- **`valid_to: YYYY-MM-DD`** — date the fact expires / needs a recheck. Past it,
  recall keeps the fact but demotes + flags it `⚠ expired`.
- **`supersedes: <slug>`** — when a new fact replaces an old one, point at the
  old slug. The old fact is then demoted (`⤴ superseded`) in recall instead of
  lingering as a second, contradictory answer. Prefer this over edit-in-place
  when the OLD value is still worth seeing (audit trail); edit in place when it
  isn't.
- **`confidence: high|medium|low`** — low/medium facts are demoted so a hunch
  never outranks a verified fact.
- **`provenance: "<source>"`** — where the fact came from, distinct from
  `compiled_by` (who wrote the note).

If your store has a CLI, it likely exposes these as flags — on 5dive, `5dive memory add` takes
`--valid-to=`, `--supersedes=`, `--confidence=`, `--provenance=`. All optional — omit them and
behaviour is unchanged, and the frontmatter fields above are the portable part.

## Anti-patterns

- A wall-of-text doc instead of atomic files.
- Research left as a standalone `notes.md` that never gets folded in — that's
  working notes, not knowledge. Compile the durable parts into the store.
- Duplicating a fact across memory AND wiki — pick one home, cross-link.
- Index entries that restate the whole file.
- Writing filler to satisfy a habit/checklist.

## Quick checklist

`[ ] durable & non-obvious? [ ] right store? [ ] updated existing vs new?`
`[ ] atomic + named + frontmatter? [ ] [[links]]? [ ] index line added?`
